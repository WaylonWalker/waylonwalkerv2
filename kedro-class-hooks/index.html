    <strong>

    to create an example pipeline.

   <p>
    A kedro class-based hook is a class with methods using the kedro lifecycle names, decorated with
    <code>
     @hook_impl
    </code>
    , If we create a class-based kedro hook without
    <code>
     self
    </code>
    in the method calls, we simply pass the hook class itself into the hooks list. And we are off.  Kedro will call each method as it hits that point in its lifecycle.  It will pass any of the possible arguments, see arguments below.  Each method has a different set of possible arguments.  You don't need to ask for all of them, but I did here so that you could see them.

    Generalizing debug_hook

    If we want to generalize the debug hook and make it a bit more re-usable across all of our projects, we can include the
    <code>
     self
    </code>
    argument, on each method and a
    <code>
     __init__
    </code>
    method in which we can configure our hook.  This will make the hook configurable.  We can now create an instance of the
    <code>
     debug_hook
    </code>
    class, and tell it which lifecycle points should trigger the debugger.

    Final thoughts
   </h2>
   <p>
    Hooks are an amazing addition to the kedro framework that will allow the community to make big changes to how their kedro project gets ran without needing to change kedro itself.  Using a hook class with self can make them so much more configurable, and reusable across different projects without a lot of extra code. Personally I still really like the module method that we used in
