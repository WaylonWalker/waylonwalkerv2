   <h1>
    Netlify
   </h1>
   <p>
    I have happily had my personal site
    <a href="https://waylonwalker.com">
     waylonwalker.com
    </a>
    hosted on netlify for nearly 2 years now.  In fact I have hosted about a dozen different toy projects to play with on there, 4 of which have gone far enough to get a custom domain name.  They are fast to deploy and consistently do so on every
    <code>
     git push
    </code>
    to main.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Zeit
   </h2>
   <p>
    I have recently started playing with zeit again.  I really like their cli tool, its dead simple and makes sense.  I tried the netlify one early on and dont think I really gave it much of a chance. I was able to backup a site we were modifying by saving everything locally (literally control+s) and running
    <code>
     now
    </code>
    in the command line.
   </p>
   <p>
    While I was on the site I realized that when switching to gatsby v2 I had deployed it to now.sh while testing, before cutting over to the updated one on netlify.  It has been building every version since without issue!
   </p>

   <h2>
    What I am using
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     gatsby
    </li>
    <li>
     forestry.io
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    I am using gatsby to build my site, and I do use forestry.io as a cms to be able to edit/manage posts online.  I think forestry is part of my problem in that it has added extra builds.  Every time I upload an image or save a post, even a draft, it pushes to production.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Why Switch
   </h2>
   <p>
    This is just a side hobby for me.  I do not make any $$ off of it, and I do not want to pay for anything I do not have to.  As I am stepping up my blogging I have already hit 50% of my build quota only 1 week into the month on netlify.  I really like what netlify is doing for the JAMstack community, but I would rather build everything locally and push to GHPages for this project than have to pay for it.
   </p>
   <h2>
    What Are your suggestions
   </h2>
   <p>
    Do you use Zeit?
   </p>
   <p>
    Where do you host your gatsby.js site?
