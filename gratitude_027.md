#### Encouragement

[CuttinScrap.com](https://www.cuttinscrap.com) was released last night!!!  I am very excited with how it is turning out.  I am even more excited to see Rhiannon start using it and getting some more content built up.  This is the by far the biggest front end project that I have ever done.  I think most of all I really like seeing how much Rhiannon likes site.   She seems blown away and has commented that she did not think that it would turn out anywhere close to this good. She would have been proud to own it either way just knowing that I built it for her.  Seeing her face light up during each preview that we did really kept me going to finish.
