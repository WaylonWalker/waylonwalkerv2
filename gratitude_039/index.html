   <h4>
    Leis
   </h4>
   <p>
    Yesterday we had the great opportunity to meet with Leis from ramsey Solutions.  We were very honored to be able to meet with such knowledgeable advisor as Leis.  He confirmed many of the things that we had in our minds and was able to offer a few suggestions for us.  Most of all I was really proud of all fo the work that Rhiannon has done to set up for the future.  The meeting with Leis confirmed that she has done everything possible to set up for success.  She had an answer for all of his questions, and had everything setup that he suggested.  Her organizational skills have really paid off.  I have a really good feeling that we are as well prepared as we can be and on track to succeed in the future.  Thank you Leis for your time! It is greatly appreciated.
