   <h4>
    Happy Birthday
   </h4>
   <p>
    Today I am very grateful for all of the wonderful birthday wishes.  I started off the day with two very excited kids.  They couldn't wait to wake up, give daddy a big hug and wish him happy birthday today.  My kids love them some birthday wishes and do all they can to make the birthday person  feel special.  Next the text messages started to roll in.  It is nice to hear from everyone that I havent heard from in awhile.  At night Scott Volunteered to bathe the kids, and get pajammas on them, while I was able to spend a  bit more time with Rhiannon.  Speaking of which...
   </p>

    I didnt forget the most special of all.  Rhiannon, my beautiful wife, was a soldier  today.  She got up, forgone the medicine, and headed out with me bright and early to take the kids to Pre-K, get coffee, and run various errands.  In which we ran into smoke on several occassions that nearly took her down.  While I was out taking Wyatt to therapy, and picking up Ayla.  She muscled through and finished my quilt, wrapped my presents, and cooked an amazing jumbalya!!

   <p>
    All in all this was one of the best days I have had in awhile, Thanks everyone!
