In 2018 I logged in to my first Linux system, setup my own webserver, data pipelines, database. I learned to use react and d3. Stepped up my python, javascript, and sql.  </p>\n<p>At home the doctor appointments keep piling in.  While I am learning to deal with it all there were several times throughout the year that I was very overwhelmed  with everything and broke down.  </p>\n<p>Here are the goals I had listed out for 2018 and how I faired at completing them.</p>\n<h3>Positivity</h3>\n<h4>The Good</h4>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue \"Favorite Things\" with family at dinner time</li>\n<li>Take 2 10min breaks per day clear the mind</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>I can say that the kids are fully on board with favorite things and love to tell everyone about how their day went.  This is a time that they are very positive and generally give praise to another family member for helping them through their day.</p>\n<h4>To Be Improved</h4>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Gratitude journaling every day</li>\n<li>Snooze Less be productive</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>I hit 61  gratitude journals in 2018.  I would not say that I met my goal, but I would definitely say that it's a great start and is something that I plan on improving next year.  I really like how it helps me focus on the positive things that happened throughout the day to find the best gratitude journal subject.  I do think the quick five minute deadline helps in that I have to be semi-prepared, which forces me to think about gratitude throughout the day.</p>\n<h3>Focus</h3>\n<p>Mediocore performance??</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>8 pomodoro</li>\n<li>up to date kanban</li>\n<li>daily/weekly planning session</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>In 2018 I wanted to set out some goals to be more focused with the time that I do have at work.  I did quite a bit of research for the best techniques throughout December, and found a system that works well for me.  I did keep up with the <em>kanban</em> system througout the year with trello.  I did not live by the board, but i did put things on there and move them.  The big thing that I found with this system is that it really made me <strong>feel</strong> productive, and gave me motivation to keep going.  While tracking my tasks throughout the day I was able to really see progress at the end of the day, and go home knowing I did some good work rather than feeling \"Where did this day go?\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am putting this back in for 2019, and I will learn to concur them.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I completely fell off of the pomodoro system.  I really feel like this system works for me and keeps me on task, I really have issues with task jumping.  It is really hard to keep on it when there are so many distractions throughout the day.  I am putting this back in for 2019, and I will learn to concur them.  The biggest challenge is people.  I have a lot of people stop by for a quick answer or to chat about a project.  I really need to set strong boundaries and tell them in X minutes I can talk, right now I am busy.</p>\n<h3>Physical Health</h3>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>active 3 days a week... ü§î</li>\n<li>eat better üëç</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>I will admit that I was not very measurable with \"eat better\", but I would say that I have done well.  I have really incorporated quite a few more vegetables into my diet, even when everyone else at the table isn't.  I throw some frozen brocoli in the microwave.  I have even started choosing vegan options at restaurants occasionally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As different things started taking over my time I was back off the wagon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I started running in the March timeframe, and really enjoyed it.  As different things started taking over my time I was back off the wagon.  Overall I would say that I am still active 3 or so days of the week with the kids.</p>\n<h3>Educational</h3>\n<p>Continuous Learning is something that I am really passionate for.  I truly believe in always learning from experiences, taking classes, watching conferences, listening to podcasts and reading blogs</p>\n<h4>The Good üëç</h4>\n<p><em>4 official courses completed</em></p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>d3 in 5 days</li>\n<li>flexbox zombies</li>\n<li>cssgrid.io</li>\n<li>datacamp sql</li>\n<li>linux command line (many blogs/youtube... not a course)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>I really stepped up my <strong>front end web skills</strong> this past year. I have started using es6, react, and building interactive web visualizations, laid out with native modern css.  These are things that I loosely understood in the past and really relied on libraries like <code class=\"language-text\">bokeh</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">dash</code> to get them to work right.</p>\n<p>I can also say that I have stopped google searching for every simple sql query that I write, Goal Complete.  I would say that I went beyond my sql goal in that I have learned to do far more than I realized was possible in the database, dramatically improving performance of my products.  I have also become the go to guy for reading/writing more complex queries.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before 2018 I had never experienced the glory of the linux command line.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before 2018 I had never experienced the glory of the linux command line.  Around May I was graced with a small on premis red hat virtual machine and my mind was quickly blown.  Many things that I have struggled to get up and working on windows simply worked right out of the box.  Webserver, task scheduling, 100% availability, and a great command line.  By the end of the year I installed Debian (wsl) on my windows machine and have converted all of my command line applications/languages to run from there, as there are far fewer compatability issues..</p>\n<h4>The flop</h4>\n<p><em>planned coursed not completed</em></p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>R</li>\n<li>Machine Learning</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Honestly I am not really hurt by not completing this one.  I really feel like I learned a ton of useful skills this year and I feel like neither of these two would have helped me progress.  R is too close to python to need both in my toolbelt without a specific project/need for it.  I did not have any projects with a dire need for ML.  I really hope to start getting some experience with it so I can have a better understanding when I should use it, but it was not a big need in any of my projects this year.</p>\n<p>Overall I am really happy with the progress from this year, and can't wait to get started next year.  Having the past few weeks off has really given me time for a reset that I didn't realize I needed.  Looking at these goals reminds me of the things that had started slipping towards the end during that last hard push to the end.</p>\n<p>üéâüéâ Hapy New Year üéâüéâ</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","devto_url":null,"devto_id":null,"title":"2018 Retrospective","description":null,"path":"2018-retrospective","twitter_cover":null,"cover":{"id":"ba31926a-d444-5ea6-bf95-44e37d1ce7ed","absolutePath":"/mnt/c/personal/ww/waylonwalkerv2/src/pages/blog/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg","childImageSharp":{"id":"f70046b2-922d-54e2-9f11-defa0f6a361d","fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":1000,"height":420,"src":"/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/9cf42/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/9cf42/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 1x,\n/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/55395/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/5858b/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 2x"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.380952380952381,"src":"/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/9cf42/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/ff9d4/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 250w,\n/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/2dc04/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 500w,\n/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/9cf42/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 1000w,\n/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/55395/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 1500w,\n/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/5858b/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 2000w,\n/static/cebfb34aefedcd511aad8e4d12399629/1816f/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 3704w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"98f236fb-3a6d-5e5a-a060-17c05ee5b1be"}}}
