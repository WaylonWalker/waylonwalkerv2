Forestry is so simple to setup.  My favorite part is that I can code up my gatsby.js site , storing all editable text in markdown, and come back later and add the CMS based on existing documents.</p>\n<h2>Configuration is Simple</h2>\n<p>Forestry.io has this amazing feature to create <em>create based on existing document</em> ü§Ø.  This is great because it sets up the <code class=\"language-text\">.yml</code> config for me without error.  And If I really want to come back later to customize it more I have that option to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../Screenshot_20190503-165248.jpg\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By far my favorite feature is <em>create based on existing document</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Multi-File Gallery</h2>\n<p>I have a use case for a photography site where the owner wants to be able to show off sample photos of each type of work she does.  I got it working in the netlify cms although it was not very user friendly.  Everything was nested in an accordian üò¢.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../Screenshot_20190507-144948.png\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Netlify multi image upload</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Next I looked into forrestry.io.  I pointed forestry.io at the existing git repo, created a template based on an existing document and <strong>BAM</strong>üí• a nice image grid appeared.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../Screenshot_20190507-145044.png\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Forestry multi image gallery</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Editor</h2>\n<p>The forestry.io editor is on point.  I can choose to edit using the WYSIWYG editor and still use markdown syntax!.  I can edit in markdown.  I can add images without fat-fingering the path and screwing up the whole post.  Its amazing!</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../2019-05-09%2010-40-11_forestry.io.png\"></p>\n<h2>Images</h2>\n<p>Image upload is on point!  Just click the add image button, it pops you into your media library, choose an image, or upload it and your off to the races üèá.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../forestry_image_3.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Im Sold üí≤</h2>\n<p>At this point I am sold. This blog is now written from Forrestry, and I love it.  It's great when I am away from my editor to make some progress on the go.  If I decide I dont like it in 6 months, I can move on. All of my content is still in markdown on the git repo.</p>\n<p> Forestry.io is missing the nice side by side preview that netlify cms has, but honestly I have struggled to set that up to.  If I am being honest I just play front end developer on the side and setting up a CMS is not something that I plan on doing every day.  I am perfectly happy having some gui tools like forestry.io setup all of the configuration for me with just a few clicks.</p>\n<h2>Bonus</h2>\n<p>Preview is Nice üëå.  Without configuring anything except a bash one liner I have a preview that is not quite instant, but does kick out my actual site with updated content quickly.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-04-23T08:02:00.000Z","devto_url":null,"devto_id":null,"title":"Forestry.io","description":"Creating Posts from forestry.io.","path":"forestry","twitter_cover":{"id":"1d296bd7-dfdb-5f14-ac21-dfbce8597bab","absolutePath":"/mnt/c/personal/ww/waylonwalkerv2/static/forest_twitter.jpg","childImageSharp":{"id":"7836858e-4149-5bf5-920d-e3e78d2fcda2","fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":500,"height":261,"src":"/static/d7991d33ce39a0225a1a36256e62e34e/713b9/forest_twitter.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d7991d33ce39a0225a1a36256e62e34e/713b9/forest_twitter.jpg 1x"}}},"cover":{"id":"ec5d1b2a-5982-5872-aaed-2eae224699bc","absolutePath":"/mnt/c/personal/ww/waylonwalkerv2/static/forest.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"id":"e9b2c467-a115-586a-bedf-2b2636a7a612","fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":1000,"height":420,"src":"/static/d0e93102048ecd9ed40a605de1780adc/9cf42/forest.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d0e93102048ecd9ed40a605de1780adc/9cf42/forest.jpg 1x"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.380952380952381,"src":"/static/d0e93102048ecd9ed40a605de1780adc/9cf42/forest.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d0e93102048ecd9ed40a605de1780adc/ff9d4/forest.jpg 250w,\n/static/d0e93102048ecd9ed40a605de1780adc/2dc04/forest.jpg 500w,\n/static/d0e93102048ecd9ed40a605de1780adc/9cf42/forest.jpg 1000w,\n/static/d0e93102048ecd9ed40a605de1780adc/5d157/forest.jpg 1100w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"35ab5cae-b82d-54fc-b3e2-3892c91576c8"}}}
