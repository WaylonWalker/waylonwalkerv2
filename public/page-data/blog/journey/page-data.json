The reason I say nearly is because my addiction is fueled with results.  I crave the output of my work enhance the work of others.  I jump with joy as I see users gain insights they could have never imagined before.  My mouth starts watering as I see their boring repetitive data mining activites be completed in a matter of seconds, opening up their mind to focus on their expertise.  The day I stop learning will be the day that I start looking for another career path. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's not all about winning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>~Mom</em></p>\n<p>This happened to me in 2014.  I have a mechanical engineering degree and had a really good position at the time.  I owned full engineering control of a small subset of engine components.  The problem was that Everything is so proprietary and hardly documented the process of learning did not click with me.  I felt like I had learned a lot about the product early on, and was stuck without anymore resources to learn more.  On the side I had started learning python and data science techniques to enhance my job.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../static/eberhard-grossgasteiger-382452-unsplash-6f1eb07825ef1b2165ea1a3805fff023.jpg\" alt=\"mountains in the fog\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everytime the I feel like I have reached the peak of any one topic the fog clears and I can now see a whole new mountain range that I did not know existed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was addicted.  I felt like there is so much knowledge easily obtained online in my free time, and I was able to take it back to my job and achieve results.  Everytime the I feel like I have reached the peak of any one topic the fog clears and I can now see a whole new mountain range that I did not know existed.</p>\n<h1>Love the Journey</h1>\n<p>By 2017 I was really good at gaining results for our business, and decided to make the jump to the data science team.  I have achieved great results, and have been recognized as a high contributor to our business.  Still I do not feel like I have won.  My goals are always moving and will always be 3-6 months ahead of me.  I truly enjoy the process of learning, and providing value so much that I will never let myself sit back and think that I have won and its time to reap the rewards of my hard work.  I will say that I am winning.  Not because of any results, awards or recognition, but because I am happy.  I have found a career path that I really enjoy the journey and I am not just trying to get on the fast track to a destination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../static/michelle-spencer-1116-unsplash-86715ac2384bc1a140cd9f01a6d0c883.jpg\" alt=\"exploring\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Life is too short to stay on a path you do not enjoy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Enjoy the journey, explore new paths, and do what brings you joy.  Life is too short to stay on a path you do not enjoy. Focus on the process not the Destination.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"It's not all about winning","description":"This is my story into data science.","path":"journey","twitter_cover":{"id":"b3a2c342-3656-562f-88da-75998625ade0","absolutePath":"/mnt/c/personal/ww/waylonwalkerv2/src/pages/blog/journey-twitter-card.jpg","childImageSharp":{"id":"7e4618b2-5aa1-5fde-9e36-e86dcd6002dc","fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQFA//EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAFnWKyU8Tyr/8QAHBAAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQREhMx/9oACAEBAAEFAoZWzurQ76iHrZyZ/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD/2gAIAQMBAT8BJ//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASMf/aAAgBAgEBPwHFP//EABoQAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIQAAEhMWH/2gAIAQEABj8CyLqHzS//xAAcEAEAAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMWFBceH/2gAIAQEAAT8hxqXUbZ5lT7Ep1ssQzzDS82T/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEH/f/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIf/aAAgBAwEBPxBsKz//xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREh/9oACAECAQE/EK8FH//EAB0QAQADAAEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQWFxofH/2gAIAQEAAT8QN23eahgaA43b+EH1PlRaqgO1HmI7AGIKW+hP/9k=","width":800,"height":418,"src":"/static/e09bf2cc09cf3a7383d974cd1544d3a1/5d469/journey-twitter-card.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e09bf2cc09cf3a7383d974cd1544d3a1/5d469/journey-twitter-card.jpg 1x,\n/static/e09bf2cc09cf3a7383d974cd1544d3a1/3d47d/journey-twitter-card.jpg 1.5x"}}},"cover":{"id":"2e870a92-7745-5fc5-9849-27397c7b9bb4","absolutePath":"/mnt/c/personal/ww/waylonwalkerv2/src/pages/blog/brett-patzke-725745-unsplash-cropped.jpg","childImageSharp":{"id":"b5ec208c-478c-5537-b970-7d74deb7bb2c","fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":800,"height":336,"src":"/static/0ab316d6ea143af554d5ef1adf0f0e4d/c6079/brett-patzke-725745-unsplash-cropped.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0ab316d6ea143af554d5ef1adf0f0e4d/c6079/brett-patzke-725745-unsplash-cropped.jpg 1x"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.380952380952381,"src":"/static/0ab316d6ea143af554d5ef1adf0f0e4d/c6079/brett-patzke-725745-unsplash-cropped.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0ab316d6ea143af554d5ef1adf0f0e4d/ff9d4/brett-patzke-725745-unsplash-cropped.jpg 250w,\n/static/0ab316d6ea143af554d5ef1adf0f0e4d/2dc04/brett-patzke-725745-unsplash-cropped.jpg 500w,\n/static/0ab316d6ea143af554d5ef1adf0f0e4d/c6079/brett-patzke-725745-unsplash-cropped.jpg 800w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6a73d770-8851-5dcf-83df-201a209a36c5"}}}
