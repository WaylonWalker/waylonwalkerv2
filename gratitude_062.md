#### Productive Break

It's nearing the end of the annual shutdown. We have had a lot of illness running through the house over the course of the break, but the last couple of days have been very productive.  We have been **Spring Cleaning**.  We have cleared out a lot of unnecessary things, scrubbed the house, and packed up a lot of things in preparation for the upcoming move.  It feels great to finally start to see some progress on these tasks after talking about them for so long.
