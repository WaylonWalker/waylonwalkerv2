   <h2>
    Markdown
   </h2>
   <p>
    My content is written in markdown, all markdown.  I find that markdown does a really great job at getting out of the way and letting ideas flow onto the page.  I am never fussing with fonts and formatting while physically writing posts.   Not that I don't spend way more time than I need to tweak these things on my own personal site where everything gets posted.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Articles
   </h2>
   <p>
    Much of what I create is inside of short articles that get posted to my personal site
    <a href="https://waylonwalker.com">
     waylonwalker.com
    </a>
    .  These will get cross-posted to
    <a href="https://dev.to/waylonwalker">
     DEV
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="https://h.waylonwalker.com/">
     hashnode
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="https://waylonwalker.medium.com/">
     Medium
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    I have made cross-posting a bit easier for myself by posting the markdown for each article next to the post on my personal site.  Add .md to any post and there is the source.
   </p>
   <p>
    Should I be giving my articles to Medium??  Personally, I am not a fan of the bait and switch that they did with adding a paywall years after launch.  From what I can tell authors are not getting paid much from it, users are discouraged when they are blocked, and they really only promote articles that are behind the paywall.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the end, I am a fan of meeting users where they are, if they like Medium I don't want them to miss my content.
   </p>
   <h2>
    More Catalytic
   </h2>
   <p>
    <em>
     soft skills
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    My articles are very code-heavy, I do want to transition over to some more evergreen type of posts that are long-lasting.  I want to create some more content around how to be a good developer, data scientist, engineer, whatever you call yourself.
   </p>
   <p>
    Personally, this is some of the content I enjoy consuming, but for some reason is not something I tend to create.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Slides
   </h2>
   <p>
    I am really enjoying the slide output of my articles on
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/waylonwalker/detail/recent-activity/shares/">
     LinkedIn
    </a>
    . It makes for something that is unique and easy to digest.  I have a pandoc script that takes in the markdown from my posts and kicks out a set of slides, so it's quick and easy to do.  Not every post works well this way by many have so
far.
   </p>

   </p>
   <h2>
    Threads
   </h2>
   <p>
    With less success (shares, views, likes) I have been converting articles over to Twitter threads as they are released, again not every article works well this way, but many do.
   </p>

   <h2>
    Simplicity
   </h2>
   <p>
    <em>
     just write markdown
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    In the end, everything needs to be simple and build off of the original markdown post.  Automation should be in a place where it makes sense.  I am no longer manually creating cover art or article descriptions, those are scripted out of the article itself.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have come cli tooling in place to simplify my process. Expect more of that to come.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Audio
   </h2>
   <p>
    I have set up a podcast where I read out my posts, but the time that I have available to read them is very constraining to the process.  It may be something that I figure out how to work out or something that I drop.  It's something that I think would be really nice, but still trying to figure out how to do it.
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="https://waylonwalker.com/audio-for-blog/">
     https://waylonwalker.com/audio-for-blog/
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    I personally really like this as I often find a cool blog article that I want to read, but it's time to cook dinner or drive somewhere.  Articles with audio make it super convenient to consume while doing a task requiring eye contact.
