> Please share your professional role as a data scientist? \[Also feel free to share about your personal projects, publications, etc.\]

I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering Degree 8 years ago.  Much of my work [early in my career](https://waylonwalker.com/blog/eight-years-cat) was wrapped around analyzing larger datasets for my group to understand quality and drive changes to improve quality or prove that quality was already good.

Three years ago I made the switch to Data Science and have loved every minute of it.  It is a very dynamic field that is continually changing and there are always a new set of skills to learn and hone in on.  I talk a lot about the mindset of always learning, sharing knowledge, and communicating in my [newsletter](http://waylonwalker.com/newsletter)

> What are the most difficult challenges you faced as a data scientist and how you resolved them?

Deployment is a high bar to enter.  Jupyter notebooks provide a suspiciouly simple start into Data Science.  Folks with very little coding experience can easily get up and running and start bringing value back into their organization, but as you want to start sharing these notbooks, re-using components of them, and scheduling them to run autonomously the bar is raised very quickly.  Many places will have teams dedicated to each piece of the process, but all too often if you want your project to be successful you have to step out of your comfort zone and do much of it yourself.

Getting started in Data Science

* Jupyter

Going to production

* packaging
* creating cli's
* linux
* bash
* cron
* CI/CD
* git
* Docker
* AWS
* Pipelines
* Schedulers/orchestration
* Virtual Machines
* hosting docs
* hosting models/apis
* Visualizations
* Databases
* blob storage
* ...

> What are the most required skills for a data scientist?

A good understanding of the business problems you are trying to solve.  This requires very good communication between Subject matter experts and the Data Science team.  

For technnical skills python is going to be my go to core skill.

* Communication
* project Estimation
* Understanding of the business problems you are trying to solve
* Python




> How a beginner can create a roadmap to become a successful data scientist in the present scenario?

> How much Maths is required to be a good data scientist? \[You can also share which concepts should everyone focus on more\]

> Will data science be replaced by AI?

Everything that we see today will be different in the future whether replaced by AI or the next hot topic.

> Words of advice for people without a Computer Science background?

You can do it

ðŸ”¼ Be flexible

ðŸ”¼ Always be open and ready for change

ðŸ”¼ Never stop learning

ðŸ”¼ Keep a positive attitude

ðŸ”¼ Be kind to others
