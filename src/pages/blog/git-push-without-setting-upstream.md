Finally after years of hand typing out a full `git push --upstream my\_really\_long\_and\_descriptive\_branch\_name` I foudn there is a setting to automatcally push to the current branch. More realisitically I just did a `git push` let git yell at me, and copying the suggestion.

``` bash
git config --global push.default current
```

This one setting will now `git push` to the current branch without yelling at you that your upstream does not match your current branch.
