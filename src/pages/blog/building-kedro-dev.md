Follow along the Journey as I build out [kedro.dev](kedro.dev).

## Building a Community

I have really enjoyed my own personal journey as I have started to build all of my data pipeline projects with the kedro framework.  I want to start building a place to share resources with the community.  I want to see this community grow and flourish.  They say in front end web development if you are not using a framework you end up building one.  That's exactly what I was doing before I started using kedro.  I want to build out a set of resources that this community can learn from and start to use the framework at their own pace without needing to develop their own from scratch.

## research

Looking into the front end frameworks to see how they welcome their community.  Much of my inspiration is from them, bringing lessons learned to data.
