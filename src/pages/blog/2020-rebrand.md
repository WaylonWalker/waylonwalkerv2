Moving into 2020 I have been really leaning on using purple as my theme color everywhere more and more.   Its time for an update to my personal site, not just because it feels plain, not just because the cover art I am using for dev.to doesn't fit my current card layout, but because I feel **inspired** and I **want** to.

## Starting point

![This is what we are working with.](/static/2020-02-10 12-17-43_Start.png)

This is what we are working with.  It has been my card design for at least a year now.  Its not bad but, its a bit play, doesnt fit my new cover art style, and that date is not working over top of the cover art text.

## Colors

I have been really into using a deep purple lately.  I feel like it is a neutral color that does not get enough respect, i.e. it's not used as frequently and kinda stands out when used.

### How I pick colors

I am really bad at picking colors that go well together so for this I punt to utilizing others who have a better eye for this.  I commonly used the instant eyedropper desktop app to pick colors out of my text editor theme or colors that [canva](canva.com "Canva") recommends.

## Feeling Inspired

Having gradients everywhere has been becoming very popular again.  Not the heavy highly saturated gradients from 00's presentation software. Gentle barely noticeable gradients, and soft gradients that flow smoothly from one color to the next.  So many splash screens and logos include these now.

I have been really inspired by the **sick** lighting that has been hot on youtube and twitch lately.  As I was gearing up to re-design my cards I saw this post by [@chrisbiscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi "@chrisbiscardi on twitter") and knew right then that I needed to do a similar lighting effect on my redesign!

## Gradient editor

I heavily used [cssgradient.io/](https://cssgradient.io/ "https://cssgradient.io/") to tweak in all of the very subtle gradients it was very common for me to put the same color on both sides and slightly pulling the color a bit darker or lighter until I liked the look.

### Matching Gradients

I had a couple of places that needed to but up gradients against each other and
