A common linting error thrown by various linters is for trailing whitespace.  I most often use flake8.  I generally have \[pre-commit\]([https://waylonwalker.com/blog/pre-commit-is-awesome](https://waylonwalker.com/blog/pre-commit-is-awesome "https://waylonwalker.com/blog/pre-commit-is-awesome")) hooks setup to strip this, but sometimes I run into situations where I jump into a project without it, and my editor lights up with errors.  A simple fix is to run this one-liner.

## One-Liner to strip whitespace

_<small><mark>bash</mark></small>_
``` bash
git grep -I --name-only -z -e '' | xargs -0 sed -i -e 's/[ \t]\+\(\r\?\)$/\1/'
```
