I started making stories as kind of a brain dump a few times per day and posting them to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waylonwalker/(https://www.linkedin.com/in/waylonwalker/).  Here are the last 11 days of stories.


I store all the stories on my website with the hopes of doing something with them on my own platform eventually. For now it makes it easy to make these posts.

``` bash
cd static/stories
ls | xargs -I {} echo '![](https://waylonwalker.com/stories/{})'
```
