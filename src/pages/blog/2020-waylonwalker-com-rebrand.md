Moving into 2020 I have been really leaning on using purple as my theme color everywhere more and more.   Its time for an update to my personal site, not just because it feels plain, not just because the cover art I am using for dev.to doesn't fit my current card layout, but because I feel **inspired** and I **want** to.

## Starting point

![This is what we are working with.](/static/2020-02-10 12-17-43_Start.png)

This is what we are working with.  It has been my card design for at least a year now.  Its not bad but, its a bit play, doesnt fit my new cover art style, and that date is not working over top of the cover art text.

* plain
* cover art does not fit
* I am not digging the date on cover art that also has text

## Inspired

As I was gearing up to re-design my cards I saw this post by [@chrisbiscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi "@chrisbiscardi on twitter") and knew right then that I needed to do the same lighting effect on my redesign!
