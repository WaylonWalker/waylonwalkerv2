I am making another push in 2021 to get my content out in the world and meeting
users where they are.  See how I plan to execute.


## Platforms

* waylonwalker.com
* Twitter
* DEV
* hashnode
* Medium
* LinkedIn

## Markdown

My content is written in markdown, all markdown.  I find that markdown does a
really great job at getting out of the way and letting ideas flow on to the
page.  I am never fussing with fonts and formatting while physicaly writing
posts.   Not that I don't spend way more timet than I need to tweaking these
things on my own personal site where everything gets posted.

## Articles

Much of what I create is inside of short articles that get posted to my
personal site [waylonwalker.com](https://waylonwalker.com).  These will get
cross posted to [DEV](https://dev.to/waylonwalker),
[hashnode](https://h.waylonwalker.com/), [Medium](https://waylonwalker.medium.com/).

I have made cross posting a bit easier for myslef by posting the markdown for
each article next to the post on my personal site.  Add .md to any post and
there is the source.

Should I be giving my articles to Medium??  Personally I am not a fan of the
bait and switch that they did with adding a paywall years after launch.  From
what I can tell authors are not getting paid much from it, users are
discouraged when they are blocked, and they really only promote articles that
are behind the paywall.

In the end I am a fan of meeting users where they are, if they like Medium I
don't want them to miss my content.

## More Catalytic
_soft skills_

My articles are very code heavy, I do want to transition over to some more
evergreen type of posts that are longer lasting.  I want to create some more
content around how to be a good developer, data scientist, engineer, whatever
you call yourself.

Personally this is some of the content I enjoy consuming, but for some reason is
not something I tend to create.

## Slides

I am really enjoying the slide output of my articles on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waylonwalker/detail/recent-activity/shares/).
It makes for something that is unique and easy to digest.  I have a pandoc
script that takes in the markdown from my posts and kicks out a set of slides,
so its quick and easy to do.  Not every post works well this way by many have so
far.

## Threads

With less success (shares, views, likes) I have been converting articles over to
twitter threads as they are released, again not every article works well this
way, but many do.

## Simplicity
_just write markdown_

In the end everything needs to be simple and build off of the original markdown
post.  Automation should be in place where it makes sense.  I am no longer
manually creating cover art or article descriptions, those are scripted out of
the article itself.

I have come cli tooling in place to simplify my process. Expect more of that to
come.
