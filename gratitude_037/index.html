   <h4>
    Kid Smarts
   </h4>
   <p>
    I cannot express how grateful I am for Rhiannon's smarts when it comes to raising small children.  These things are complicated and only continue to get more complicated as they grow!  There are times where I am just not quite sure what to do or how to handle certain situations, and she will come back with an answer that makes sense.  Giving an understanding about how that would make the child feel in the moment and what it will do to them in the long term.  As I am growing these understandings things are making more sense, but I still feel like I have a lot to learn when it comes to parenting.  I am not only grateful that she takes the lead on the research and develops new strategies as they grow, but she is also able to present to me in a way that makes sense.
