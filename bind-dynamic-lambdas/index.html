    This past week I had a really weird bug in my
    <a href="https://kedro.readthedocs.io/">
     kedro
    </a>
    pipeline.  For some reason data running through my pipeline was coming out completely made no sense, but if I manually request raw data outside of the pipeline it matched expectations.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     NOTE
    </strong>
    While this story is about a kedro pipeline, it can be applied anywhere closures are put into an iterable.

   <h2>

   </h2>
   <p>
    After a few days of looking at it off and on, I pinpointed that it was all the way down in the raw layer. Right as data is coming off of the database.  For this I already had existing
    <code>
     sql
    </code>
    files stored and a
    <code>
     read_sql
    </code>
    function to get the data so I opted to just set up the pipeline to utilize the existing code as much as possible, leaning on the
    <a href="https://kedro.readthedocs.io/">
     kedro
    </a>
    framework a bit less.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have dynamically created lists of pipeline nodes many times in the past, but typically I take data from
    <a href="https://kedro.readthedocs.io/">
     kedro
    </a>
    input and use it in the lambda.  I prefer the simplicity of using lambdas over
    <code>
     functools.partial
    </code>
    .  It typically looks something like this.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python"># üëç  I do this all the time
from kedro.pipeline import node
from my_generic_project_lib import clean

datasets_to_clean = ['sales', 'production', 'inventory']
nodes = []
for dataset in datasets_to_clean:
   nodes.append(
      node(
         func=lambda x: clean(x)
         inputs = f'raw_{dataset}'
         outputs=f'int_{dataset}'
         tags=['int', dataset]
         name=f'create_int_{dataset}'
      )
   )</code></pre>
   <p>
    What was different this time is that I needed to pass in the name of the dataset to my read_sql function, not the data loaded in the framework.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python"># ‚ùå This does not work
from kedro.pipeline import node
from my_generic_project_lib import read_sql

datasets_to_read = ['sales', 'production', 'inventory']
nodes = []
for dataset in datasets_to_clean:
   nodes.append(
      node(
         func=lambda: read_sql(dataset) # üí• The major issue
         inputs = f'dummy'
         outputs=f'int_{dataset}'
         tags=['int', dataset]
         name=f'create_int_{dataset}'
      )
   )</code></pre>
   <h2>
    <img alt="Seriously" src="https://waylonwalker.com/bind-dynamic-lambdas-2.png"/>
   </h2>
   <p>
    As I am still oblivious to what has happened I pop in a
    <code>
     breakpoint()
    </code>
    and quickly see that during the first run the dataset passed into
    <code>
     read_sql
    </code>
    was
    <code>
     'inventory'
    </code>
    , in fact, every single one was
    <code>
     'inventory'
    </code>
    .  The lambda is just using the latest value of dataset from outside and has no
    <code>
     local
    </code>
    <code>
     dataset
    </code>
    attached to it.

    I made a slightly more simple example so that you can try it and play with it yourself, edit it, share it with your friends, laugh at my mistake, whatever you like.
