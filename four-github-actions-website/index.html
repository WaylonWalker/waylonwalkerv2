    GitHub's actions are a new GitHub feature that will trigger GitHub to spin up a virtual machine and run some tasks with some special access to your repo. It can interact with comments/issues, it can clone your repo, You can explicitly pass in secrets so that it can commit back to the repo or deploy to another service. The environment may be a Linux, windows, or even a mac machine. I believe this is wildly incredible for the open-source community, putting these tools in the same place that we are already collaborating is so convenient.

    What can they do for my personal website? ðŸ¤”

    GitHub actions can give you confidence that your site is up and running, with the latest JavaScript packages, does not have broken links, and can even take screenshots of what your website looks like on different screen sizes and operating systems.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     periodically check that the website is up
    </li>
    <li>
     update npm
    </li>
    <li>
     url checker
    </li>
    <li>
     screenshot website
    </li>

    is an action that you can run on any public website. I run this one several times every day and it gives me confidence that my various sites are still up and running. It ensures that my build didn't break something, nothing is wrong with my hosting provider, or my DNS.
