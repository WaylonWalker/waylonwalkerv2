    I want to incorporate some of the wonderful comments, ðŸ’•, ðŸ¦„, and ðŸ”–'s that I have been getting on
    <strong>
     dev.to
    </strong>
    on my website.  I have dabbled once or twice with no avail this time I am taking notes on my journey, so follow along and let's get there together.  By the end of this post, I will have a way to get comments from posts on the client-side thanks to the wonderfully open dev.to API.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The API
   </h2>
   <p>
    dev.to has an open API that allows us to easily get comments as HTML.  They have their API hosted at
    <a href="https://docs.dev.to/api/#tag/comments">
     https://docs.dev.to/api/#tag/comments
    </a>
    , let's take a look at it.
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="" src="https://waylonwalker.com/dev-to-api-comments.png"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    Here we can see that going to
    <a href="https://dev.to/api/comments?a_id=270180">
     https://dev.to/api/comments?a_id=270180
    </a>
    returns us some json, that contains an array of comments.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json">[
  {body_html: '&lt;the comment rendered as html&gt;',
   user: {&lt;an array with quite a bit of information about the commenting user&gt;},
   children: [&lt;an array of child comment objects&gt;]
   &lt;other stuff we don't care about&gt;
  },
  &lt;more comments&gt;
  ]</code></pre>
   <h2>
    What the heck is that a_id
   </h2>
   <p>
    That is an
    <code>
     article_id
    </code>
    .  Though a bit of searching I found that it occurs in at least four places on every page as a data attribute.  Using chrome dev tools I found a good place to "query" it from.
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="" src="https://waylonwalker.com/dev-to-article-id.png"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    With this knowledge, we can fetch the contents of an article and pull the
    <code>
     articleId
    </code>
    from it.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript">    async function getDevToAId(url) {
        // Gets the articleId of a dev.to article
        const root = 'https://dev.to/'
        if (!url.includes(root)) {
            url = root + url
        }
        let domparser = new DOMParser()
        const html = await fetch(url).then(r =&gt; r.text())
        const doc = domparser.parseFromString(html, 'text/html')
        const articleId = doc.querySelector('#article-body').dataset.articleId
        return articleId
    }</code></pre>
   <p>
    <strong>
     note
    </strong>
    I do check to see if a full URL or slug was given, if it was just the slug I tack on
    <code>
     https://dev.to/
    </code>
    before fetching.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Now the comments
   </h2>
   <p>
    The main event is here, what you all have waited for, and it's by far the easiest part.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript">    async function getDevToComments(url) {
        const articleId = await getDevToAId(url)
        const response = await fetch(`https://dev.to/api/comments?a_id=${articleId}`)
        const comments = await response.json()
        return comments
    }</code></pre>
   <p>
    The hardest part of this was figuring out what the
    <code>
     a_id
    </code>
    was and how I was going to get it from some more commonly known information about my articles, the URL, or the slug
