This year I want to be able to bring it up a notch.  <strong>Intentionality</strong> plays a big part in this.  Taking some time to sit down and think about the tasks you realistically want to complete for the day, then focusing on those tasks one at a time.</p>\n<p>I started off the year last year using the <strong>pomodoro</strong> system to focus on one task and one task only for 25 minutes at a time.  This worked really well for me but I quickly fell off of the train and fell into my old trap of reacting to the loudest customer over the items I put <strong>intensionally</strong> on my todo list.</p>\n<p>A <strong>kanban</strong> system is key to keeping it intentional.  I currently use a very simple trello system, with very few cards.  This helps to stay on track during those 25 minutes.  During the pomodoro session I move an item from todo, to doing, work that item, then move it to done when it is ready.  The only other thing that I can do during that time is to add items to the todo list.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>pomodoro</p>\n<ul>\n<li>8 pomodori</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Daily session planning</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Back on inbox zero</li>\n<li>todo's go in kanban not inbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Leave a Legacy</h3>\n<p>I want to leave behind a legacy that I can be proud of. I want to be known for bringing a positive attitude that inspires others to do their best work, enourage others, and work as a team.  It is in my blood to help as many people as I can.  I am in a unique role and have a unique skill set that allows me to do what would take some hours and days in minutes and hours.  I really enjoy helping these folks, but I know many of them are smart enough to do it on their own, they just do not know where to get started.  For this reason I really want to amp up my docs this year.  I want people to be able to answer 80% of their questions right from the docs before needing to come to me to get started.  I want this to be part of the legacy that I leave with my projects for the next person that encounters them.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>better docs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>80% oss questions should be answered</li>\n<li>finish pea course</li>\n<li>all projects have docs page with link by Feb</li>\n<li>consistent docs format</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>bring positivity to the workplace</li>\n<li>\n<p>blog weekly (52)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lower barier to entry</li>\n<li>consistently work on writing skills</li>\n<li>12 Medium/LinkedIn</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Educational</h3>\n<p>Last year I made monumental improvements to my web development while continuing to hone my backend skills.  This year I want to amp up my web front end skills even more. I am finding this to be an area that not very many people in my organization have and I can knock out some simple projects really quick and gain a lot of value.  Last year I started using <strong>react</strong> as a front end framework.  I want to double down learning the intricicies of how it works, and how to effectively layout a react project. I also want to keep upping my design skills.  As I do more layouts I find that they are easier and easier to layout, and as I am able to get them out faster it give me more time to hone in the design. Lastly I want to continue honing in my backend skills.  Working with data pipelines, Linux command line, the cloud, and database architecture.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced React <em>dynamic web applications</em></li>\n<li>Refactoring UI <em>Rethinking how to layout data in logical ways</em></li>\n<li>Service Workies</li>\n<li>AWS?? <em>we are moving to the cloud</em></li>\n<li>Continue Leveling up Linux Command Line</li>\n<li>Data Pipeline</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Personal</h2>\n<p>At home I want to continue being a positive person.  Home is much harder to keep up a good attitude.  Mostly because I care more about my family and its harder to walk away and forget about a bad interaction with them.  I want to make sure that we keep up more positive interactions together as that will help everyone keep the positive attitude.  Lastly I would like to keep in touch with family better.  Rhiannon really loves a nice message to boost her day.  I would like to send her a few longer messages per week, and to one other family member at least once per week.  This can be in the form of a text, email, or hard copy letter in the mail.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>be your best</p>\n<ul>\n<li>+3 positives everyday (300+)</li>\n<li>gratitude daily (300+)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>5 languages</li>\n<li>letters to family</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Bring it on 2019</strong>  I am ready to take it on!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/goals-2019/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"2019 goals","description":"2019 goals","status":"published","cover":{"absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/waylonwalkerv2/waylonwalkerv2/src/pages/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg","xsm_img":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/2c7f8/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg","srcWebp":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/f6b6d/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.webp"}},"sm_img":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/9dc27/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg","srcWebp":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/403a4/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.webp"}},"med_img":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/0f3a1/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg","srcWebp":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/e9589/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.webp"}},"full":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":1000,"height":420,"src":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/9cf42/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/9cf42/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg 1x,\n/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/55395/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/5858b/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg 2x"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.380952380952381,"src":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/9cf42/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/ff9d4/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg 250w,\n/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/2dc04/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg 500w,\n/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/9cf42/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg 1000w,\n/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/55395/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg 1500w,\n/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/5858b/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg 2000w,\n/static/a84804466e0ac0bea3db2fd8d1efced7/d39f0/steve-halama-1275997-unsplash.jpg 3825w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bb8470cb-3621-5c1b-8133-7fcfaf3422ad","prev":{"id":"0ba07103-a09e-5d38-8283-e361439b0b76","html":"<h2>GitUI</h2>\n<p>Gitui is a terminal-based git user interface (TUI) that will change the way\nthat you work with git. </p>\n<h2>Works alongside the cli</h2>\n<p>I have been a long-time user of the git cli, and it's\nbeen hard to beat, mostly because there is nothing that keeps my fingers on the\nkeyboard quite like it, except <code class=\"language-text\">gitui</code> which comes with some great ways to very\nquickly walk through a git project.</p>\n<h2>installation</h2>\n<p>Go to their [releases]<a href=\"https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui/releases\">https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui/releases</a>) page,\ndownload the latest build, and pop it on your PATH.

You can easily create a catalog as shown above.  Since the kedro catalog variable is typically <code class=\"language-text\">catalog</code>, we will call it <code class=\"language-text\">new_catalog</code> and add it to the existing <code class=\"language-text\">catalog</code> below.  If you are not quite sure what that <code class=\"language-text\">**catalog</code> syntax is doing check out my article on <code class=\"language-text\">**kwargs</code>.</p>\n<div
