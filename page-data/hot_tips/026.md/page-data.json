I pushed hard over the past two weeks and just made a lot of content about things that I actually do.  Many of these were things that I know quite well and were quite quick to write.  I really enjoyed putting them out there and seeing all of the comments and feedback roll in.</p>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com/testproject-io-py-actions/\">Integration testing with Python, TestProject.io, and GitHub Actions</a></h3>\n<p>I learned the most from this post.  It's been awhile since I had done any testing with selenium and I wanted to brush up on those skills for some upcoming work.  I chose to test my own website, run it on github actions and use TestProject for reporting.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com/reusable-bash/\">Creating Reusable Bash Scripts</a></h3>\n<p>I've been writing a ton of bash scripts lately.  In this article I write down a few of the things that I have recently learned to make my scripts just a bit better.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://dev.to/waylonwalker/what-s-on-your-github-profile-40p3\">ü§ì What's on your GitHub Profile</a></h3>\n<p>GitHub profiles were released recently and I asked on DEV.to \"Whats on your GitHub Profile\".  This was a discussion that turned out some incredible response.  There are so many great profiles posted in the discussion section.  Check them out for inspiration on yours.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://dev.to/waylonwalker/how-to-crush-amazing-posts-on-dev-4cgh\">üî• How to crush amazing posts on DEV</a></h3>\n<p>This post was super fun to write.  It's specifically for writing DEV.to posts, but is generally useful to any medium length content that sits between a tweet and a book.  I definitly learned a few things during research and in the discussion.  I have picked up a few tricks that make my posts a bit easier to scan and get a bit better engagement than having a wall of text.</p>\n<h2>Recent Posts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com/reusable-bash/\">Creating Reusable Bash Scripts</a></p>\n<p>Bash is a language that is quite useful for automation no matter what language you write in. Bash can do so many powerful system-level tasks. Even if you are on windows these days you are likely to come across bash inside a cloud VM, Continuous Integration, or even inside of docker.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com/3-things-to-automate-with-python/\">Three things to Automate with Python using Pandas</a></p>\n<p>Here are three things that I see my non programming counterparts doing every single day.

They spoke about the black tech pipeline as well as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Pariss is quite an inspiration. She has done so much work to create a better place for POC in tech. I like that not only is she helping them get jobs but acting as a mentor for their first few months on the job to make sure that they are able to find their place and fit in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com/whats-new-in-kedro-0164/\">What's New in Kedro 0.16.4</a></p>\n<p>If we take a look at the release notes I see one <strong>major</strong> feature improvement on the list, auto-discovery of hooks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com/testproject-io-py-actions/\">Integration testing with Python, TestProject.io, and GitHub Actions</a></p>\n<p>As I continue to build out <a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com/\">https://waylonwalker.com/</a> I sometimes run into some errors that are not caught becuase I do not have good testing implemented.

In order for me to show up to practice I need to make it easy to show up. An easy way to show up to practice with python is to use an online repl. With these you can try out something quick.
