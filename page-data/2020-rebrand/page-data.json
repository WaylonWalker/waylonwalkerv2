Its time for an update to my personal site, not just because it feels plain, not just because the cover art I am using for dev.to doesn't fit my current card layout, but because I feel <strong>inspired</strong> and I <strong>want</strong> to.</p>\n<h2>Starting point</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../../2020-02-10%2012-17-43_Start.png\" alt=\"This is what we are working with.\"></p>\n<p>This is what we are working with.  It has been my card design for at least a year now.  Its not bad but, its a bit play, doesnt fit my new cover art style, and that date is not working over top of the cover art text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>plain</li>\n<li>cover art does not fit</li>\n<li>I am not digging the date on cover art that also has text</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Colors</h2>\n<p>I have been really into using a deep purple lately.  It is a neutral color that does not get enough respect, i.e. it's not used as frequently and kinda stands out when used.</p>\n<h3>How I pick colors</h3>\n<p>I am really bad at picking colors that go well together so for this I punt to utilizing others who have a better eye for this.  I commonly used the <a href=\"https://instant-eyedropper.com/\" title=\"instant-eyedropper website\">instant-eyedropper</a> desktop app to pick colors out of my text editor theme or colors that <a href=\"https://canva.com\" title=\"Canva\">canva</a> recommends.  Really just find soemthing that seems to match up with your taste, goes well with a color that you want to highlight or anything that inspires you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../how-i-pick-colors.gif\"></p>\n<h3>Tweaking colors</h3>\n<p>Once I get a couple of colors working well together its very common that I need to tweak them slightly.  Generally I hold the hue and change only the saturation and lightness.  It would probably make more sense for me to use hsla, but for some reason I always end up with a messy pallet trying to use numbers.  I typically just google color picker and use the one built into google search.  There are probably ones built into vscode now, but I have been doing this for years now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../how-i-adjust-colors.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Gradient editor</h2>\n<p>I heavily used <a href=\"https://cssgradient.io/\" title=\"https://cssgradient.io/\">cssgradient.io/</a> to tweak in all of the very subtle gradients it was very common for me to put the same color on both sides and slightly pulling the color a bit darker or lighter until I liked the look.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../how-i-create-gradients.gif\"></p>\n<h3>Matching Gradients</h3>\n<p>I had a couple of places that needed to but up gradients against each other seemlessly.  I am sure there are better ways to do it.  I would likerally take instant eyedropper, get the color right on the border, then plug that into cssgradient.io.</p>\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n<p>So far I have swapped out my card colors, and some of the text colors.  I also moved the date off of the cover image as I have been putting text on my cover images since starting to cross post to dev.to.  I did not like how they clashed and moved the text.   I also swapped over from gatsby fixed and gatsby fluid to make sure that the cover art always fits the card correctly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../2020-02-15%2009-36-31_Start.png\"></p>\n<h2>Feeling Inspired</h2>\n<p>Having gradients everywhere has been becoming very popular again.  Not the heavy highly saturated gradients from 00's presentation software. Gentle barely noticeable gradients, and soft gradients that flow smoothly from one color to the next.  So many splash screens and logos include these now.</p>\n<p>I have been really inspired by the <strong>sick</strong> lighting that has been hot on youtube and twitch lately.  As I was gearing up to re-design my cards I saw this post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi\" title=\"@chrisbiscardi on twitter\">@chrisbiscardi</a> and knew right then that I needed to do a similar lighting effect on my redesign!  This was literally my jumping off point at which I started the re-design.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../inspiration-for-new-post-card-2020-Chris-Biscardi.png\"></p>\n<h3>Shadows</h3>\n<p>For this step I did not use any tooling, though I found some that could have been helpful later.  I literally just started stacking up different colors of box shadow, pulling a big blur, shifting them around, and adjusting the color opacity until everything looks just right.  Again I went really subtle here, comparing back to Chris's backdrop I am a bit more subtle than even that.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token property\">box-shadow</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n   -8rem -6rem 8rem -6rem <span class=\"token function\">rgba</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>253<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 221<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 88<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> .2<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n   4rem 0 8rem <span class=\"token function\">rgba</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>88<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 82<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 185<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> .3<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n   .2rem .2rem 1rem <span class=\"token function\">rgba</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> .2<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Complete format</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../../new-post-card-2020.png\"></p>\n<h2>A few days too late</h2>\n<p>A few days later I saw this thread of tweets by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">@sarah_edo</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swyx\">@swyx</a> and realized that this style is called <strong>neomorphism</strong>.

In 2018 I logged in to my first Linux system, setup my own webserver, data pipelines, database. I learned to use react and d3. Stepped up my python, javascript, and sql.</p>\n<p>At home the doctor appointments keep piling in.  While I am learning to deal with it all there were several times throughout the year that I was very overwhelmed  with everything and broke down.</p>\n<p>Here are the goals I had listed out for 2018 and how I faired at completing them.</p>\n<h3>Positivity</h3>\n<h4>The Good</h4>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue \"Favorite Things\" with family at dinner time</li>\n<li>Take 2 10min breaks per day clear the mind</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>I can say that the kids are fully on board with favorite things and love to tell everyone about how their day went.  This is a time that they are very positive and generally give praise to another family member for helping them through their day.</p>\n<h4>To Be Improved</h4>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Gratitude journaling every day</li>\n<li>Snooze Less be productive</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>I hit 61  gratitude journals in 2018.  I would not say that I met my goal, but I would definitely say that it's a great start and is something that I plan on improving next year.  I really like how it helps me focus on the positive things that happened throughout the day to find the best gratitude journal subject.  I do think the quick five minute deadline helps in that I have to be semi-prepared, which forces me to think about gratitude throughout the day.</p>\n<h3>Focus</h3>\n<p>Mediocore performance??</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>8 pomodoro</li>\n<li>up to date kanban</li>\n<li>daily/weekly planning session</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>In 2018 I wanted to set out some goals to be more focused with the time that I do have at work.  I did quite a bit of research for the best techniques throughout December, and found a system that works well for me.  I did keep up with the <em>kanban</em> system througout the year with trello.  I did not live by the board, but i did put things on there and move them.  The big thing that I found with this system is that it really made me <strong>feel</strong> productive, and gave me motivation to keep going.  While tracking my tasks throughout the day I was able to really see progress at the end of the day, and go home knowing I did some good work rather than feeling \"Where did this day go?\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am putting this back in for 2019, and I will learn to concur them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I completely fell off of the pomodoro system.  I really feel like this system works for me and keeps me on task, I really have issues with task jumping.  It is really hard to keep on it when there are so many distractions throughout the day.  I am putting this back in for 2019, and I will learn to concur them.  The biggest challenge is people.  I have a lot of people stop by for a quick answer or to chat about a project.  I really need to set strong boundaries and tell them in X minutes I can talk, right now I am busy.</p>\n<h3>Physical Health</h3>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>active 3 days a week... 🤔</li>\n<li>eat better 👍</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>I will admit that I was not very measurable with \"eat better\", but I would say that I have done well.  I have really incorporated quite a few more vegetables into my diet, even when everyone else at the table isn't.  I throw some frozen brocoli in the microwave.  I have even started choosing vegan options at restaurants occasionally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As different things started taking over my time I was back off the wagon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I started running in the March timeframe, and really enjoyed it.  As different things started taking over my time I was back off the wagon.  Overall I would say that I am still active 3 or so days of the week with the kids.</p>\n<h3>Educational</h3>\n<p>Continuous Learning is something that I am really passionate for.  I truly believe in always learning from experiences, taking classes, watching conferences, listening to podcasts and reading blogs</p>\n<h4>The Good 👍</h4>\n<p><em>4 official courses completed</em></p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>d3 in 5 days</li>\n<li>flexbox zombies</li>\n<li>cssgrid.io</li>\n<li>datacamp sql</li>\n<li>linux command line (many blogs/youtube... not a course)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>I really stepped up my <strong>front end web skills</strong> this past year. I have started using es6, react, and building interactive web visualizations, laid out with native modern css.  These are things that I loosely understood in the past and really relied on libraries like <code class=\"language-text\">bokeh</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">dash</code> to get them to work right.</p>\n<p>I can also say that I have stopped google searching for every simple sql query that I write, Goal Complete.  I would say that I went beyond my sql goal in that I have learned to do far more than I realized was possible in the database, dramatically improving performance of my products.  I have also become the go to guy for reading/writing more complex queries.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before 2018 I had never experienced the glory of the linux command line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before 2018 I had never experienced the glory of the linux command line.  Around May I was graced with a small on premis red hat virtual machine and my mind was quickly blown.  Many things that I have struggled to get up and working on windows simply worked right out of the box.  Webserver, task scheduling, 100% availability, and a great command line.  By the end of the year I installed Debian (wsl) on my windows machine and have converted all of my command line applications/languages to run from there, as there are far fewer compatability issues..</p>\n<h4>The flop</h4>\n<p><em>planned coursed not completed</em></p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>R</li>\n<li>Machine Learning</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Honestly I am not really hurt by not completing this one.  I really feel like I learned a ton of useful skills this year and I feel like neither of these two would have helped me progress.  R is too close to python to need both in my toolbelt without a specific project/need for it.  I did not have any projects with a dire need for ML.  I really hope to start getting some experience with it so I can have a better understanding when I should use it, but it was not a big need in any of my projects this year.</p>\n<p>Overall I am really happy with the progress from this year, and can't wait to get started next year.  Having the past few weeks off has really given me time for a reset that I didn't realize I needed.  Looking at these goals reminds me of the things that had started slipping towards the end during that last hard push to the end.</p>\n<p>🎉🎉 Hapy New Year 🎉🎉</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2018-retrospective/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":null,"title":"2018 Retrospective","description":null,"templateKey":"blog-post","status":"published","date":"2019-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","cover":{"med_img":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":500,"height":333,"src":"/static/18412670dbf99923a96712a5058df0ee/0f3a1/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/18412670dbf99923a96712a5058df0ee/0f3a1/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 1x,\n/static/18412670dbf99923a96712a5058df0ee/f9913/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/18412670dbf99923a96712a5058df0ee/a7715/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 2x"}},"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":200,"height":85,"src":"/static/18412670dbf99923a96712a5058df0ee/a6613/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/18412670dbf99923a96712a5058df0ee/a6613/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 1x,\n/static/18412670dbf99923a96712a5058df0ee/b97e6/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/18412670dbf99923a96712a5058df0ee/eeb4b/namroud-gorguis-253765-unsplash.jpg 2x"}}}}},"next":{"id":"a39e2283-cb89-5775-9859-6e981ddc612a","html":"<p>I am making another push in 2021 to get my content out in the world and meeting users where they are.

Personally, I am not a fan of the bait and switch that they did with adding a paywall years after launch.  From what I can tell authors are not getting paid much from it, users are discouraged when they are blocked, and they really only promote articles that are behind the paywall.</p>\n<p>In the end, I am a fan of meeting users where they are, if they like Medium I don't want them to miss my content.</p>\n<h2>More Catalytic</h2>\n<p><em>soft skills</em></p>\n<p>My articles are very code-heavy, I do want to transition over to some more evergreen type of posts that are long-lasting.  I want to create some more content around how to be a good developer, data scientist, engineer, whatever you call yourself.</p>\n<p>Personally, this is some of the content I enjoy consuming, but for some reason is not something I tend to create.</p>\n<h2>Slides</h2>\n<p>I am really enjoying the slide output of my articles on\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/waylonwalker/detail/recent-activity/shares/\">LinkedIn</a>. It makes for something that is unique and easy to digest.  I have a pandoc script that takes in the markdown from my posts and kicks out a set of slides, so it's quick and easy to do.  Not every post works well this way by many have so\nfar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://waylonwalker.com/linkedin-activity-slides.gif\" alt=\"my linked in slide\nactivity\"></p>\n<h2>Threads</h2>\n<p>With less success (shares, views, likes) I have been converting articles over to Twitter threads as they are released, again not every article works well this way, but many do.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What does it take to create an installable python package that can be hosted on pypi?<br><br>.<br>├── setup .py<br>└── my_module.py<br><br>🧵▶ <a href=\"https://t.co/G7V84Uk4IO\">pic.twitter.com/G7V84Uk4IO</a></p>&mdash; Waylon Walker 🐍 (@_WaylonWalker) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_WaylonWalker/status/1349716127887347717?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 14, 2021</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h2>Simplicity</h2>\n<p><em>just write markdown</em></p>\n<p>In the end, everything needs to be simple and build off of the original markdown post.  Automation should be in a place where it makes sense.  I am no longer manually creating cover art or article descriptions, those are scripted out of the article itself.</p>\n<p>I have come cli tooling in place to simplify my process. Expect more of that to come.</p>\n<h2>Audio</h2>\n<p>I have set up a podcast where I read out my posts, but the time that I have available to read them is very constraining to the process.  It may be something that I figure out how to work out or something that I drop.  It's something that I think would be really nice, but still trying to figure out how to do it.</p>\n<a class=\"onelinelink\" href=\"https://waylonwalker.com/audio-for-blog/\">\n<img style=\"float: right;\" align=\"right\" src=\"https://waylonwalker.com/static/a8606be154d71412741094d011b75098/630fb/audio-for-blog-xmas2020.png\" alt=\"article cover for Adding Audio to my blog posts\">\n<div class=\"right\">\n    <h2>Adding Audio to my blog posts</h2>\n    <p class=\"description\">\n    This is episode 1 of the Waylon Walker Audio experience, posts from waylonwalker.com in audio form.
