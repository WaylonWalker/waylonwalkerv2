See how I plan to execute.</p>\n<h2>Platforms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>waylonwalker.com</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>DEV</li>\n<li>hashnode</li>\n<li>Medium</li>\n<li>LinkedIn</li>\n<li>Anchor</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Markdown</h2>\n<p>My content is written in markdown, all markdown.  I find that markdown does a really great job at getting out of the way and letting ideas flow onto the page.  I am never fussing with fonts and formatting while physically writing posts.   Not that I don't spend way more time than I need to tweak these things on my own personal site where everything gets posted.</p>\n<h2>Articles</h2>\n<p>Much of what I create is inside of short articles that get posted to my personal site <a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com\">waylonwalker.com</a>.  These will get cross-posted to <a href=\"https://dev.to/waylonwalker\">DEV</a>,\n<a href=\"https://h.waylonwalker.com/\">hashnode</a>, <a href=\"https://waylonwalker.medium.com/\">Medium</a>.</p>\n<p>I have made cross-posting a bit easier for myself by posting the markdown for each article next to the post on my personal site.  Add .md to any post and there is the source.</p>\n<p>Should I be giving my articles to Medium??  Personally, I am not a fan of the bait and switch that they did with adding a paywall years after launch.  From what I can tell authors are not getting paid much from it, users are discouraged when they are blocked, and they really only promote articles that are behind the paywall.</p>\n<p>In the end, I am a fan of meeting users where they are, if they like Medium I don't want them to miss my content.</p>\n<h2>More Catalytic</h2>\n<p><em>soft skills</em></p>\n<p>My articles are very code-heavy, I do want to transition over to some more evergreen type of posts that are long-lasting.  I want to create some more content around how to be a good developer, data scientist, engineer, whatever you call yourself.</p>\n<p>Personally, this is some of the content I enjoy consuming, but for some reason is not something I tend to create.</p>\n<h2>Slides</h2>\n<p>I am really enjoying the slide output of my articles on\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/waylonwalker/detail/recent-activity/shares/\">LinkedIn</a>. It makes for something that is unique and easy to digest.  I have a pandoc script that takes in the markdown from my posts and kicks out a set of slides, so it's quick and easy to do.  Not every post works well this way by many have so\nfar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://waylonwalker.com/linkedin-activity-slides.gif\" alt=\"my linked in slide\nactivity\"></p>\n<h2>Threads</h2>\n<p>With less success (shares, views, likes) I have been converting articles over to Twitter threads as they are released, again not every article works well this way, but many do.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What does it take to create an installable python package that can be hosted on pypi?<br><br>.<br>‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup .py<br>‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_module.py<br><br>üßµ‚ñ∂ <a href=\"https://t.co/G7V84Uk4IO\">pic.twitter.com/G7V84Uk4IO</a></p>&mdash; Waylon Walker üêç (@_WaylonWalker) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_WaylonWalker/status/1349716127887347717?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 14, 2021</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h2>Simplicity</h2>\n<p><em>just write markdown</em></p>\n<p>In the end, everything needs to be simple and build off of the original markdown post.  Automation should be in a place where it makes sense.  I am no longer manually creating cover art or article descriptions, those are scripted out of the article itself.</p>\n<p>I have come cli tooling in place to simplify my process. Expect more of that to come.</p>\n<h2>Audio</h2>\n<p>I have set up a podcast where I read out my posts, but the time that I have available to read them is very constraining to the process.  It may be something that I figure out how to work out or something that I drop.  It's something that I think would be really nice, but still trying to figure out how to do it.</p>\n<a class=\"onelinelink\" href=\"https://waylonwalker.com/audio-for-blog/\">\n<img style=\"float: right;\" align=\"right\" src=\"https://waylonwalker.com/static/a8606be154d71412741094d011b75098/630fb/audio-for-blog-xmas2020.png\" alt=\"article cover for Adding Audio to my blog posts\">\n<div class=\"right\">\n    <h2>Adding Audio to my blog posts</h2>\n    <p class=\"description\">\n    This is episode 1 of the Waylon Walker Audio experience, posts from waylonwalker.com in audio form.

Its time for an update to my personal site, not just because it feels plain, not just because the cover art I am using for dev.to doesn't fit my current card layout, but because I feel <strong>inspired</strong> and I <strong>want</strong> to.</p>\n<h2>Starting point</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../../2020-02-10%2012-17-43_Start.png\" alt=\"This is what we are working with.\"></p>\n<p>This is what we are working with.  It has been my card design for at least a year now.  Its not bad but, its a bit play, doesnt fit my new cover art style, and that date is not working over top of the cover art text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>plain</li>\n<li>cover art does not fit</li>\n<li>I am not digging the date on cover art that also has text</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Colors</h2>\n<p>I have been really into using a deep purple lately.  It is a neutral color that does not get enough respect, i.e. it's not used as frequently and kinda stands out when used.</p>\n<h3>How I pick colors</h3>\n<p>I am really bad at picking colors that go well together so for this I punt to utilizing others who have a better eye for this.  I commonly used the <a href=\"https://instant-eyedropper.com/\" title=\"instant-eyedropper website\">instant-eyedropper</a> desktop app to pick colors out of my text editor theme or colors that <a href=\"https://canva.com\" title=\"Canva\">canva</a> recommends.  Really just find soemthing that seems to match up with your taste, goes well with a color that you want to highlight or anything that inspires you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../how-i-pick-colors.gif\"></p>\n<h3>Tweaking colors</h3>\n<p>Once I get a couple of colors working well together its very common that I need to tweak them slightly.  Generally I hold the hue and change only the saturation and lightness.  It would probably make more sense for me to use hsla, but for some reason I always end up with a messy pallet trying to use numbers.  I typically just google color picker and use the one built into google search.  There are probably ones built into vscode now, but I have been doing this for years now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../how-i-adjust-colors.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Gradient editor</h2>\n<p>I heavily used <a href=\"https://cssgradient.io/\" title=\"https://cssgradient.io/\">cssgradient.io/</a> to tweak in all of the very subtle gradients it was very common for me to put the same color on both sides and slightly pulling the color a bit darker or lighter until I liked the look.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../how-i-create-gradients.gif\"></p>\n<h3>Matching Gradients</h3>\n<p>I had a couple of places that needed to but up gradients against each other seemlessly.  I am sure there are better ways to do it.  I would likerally take instant eyedropper, get the color right on the border, then plug that into cssgradient.io.</p>\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n<p>So far I have swapped out my card colors, and some of the text colors.  I also moved the date off of the cover image as I have been putting text on my cover images since starting to cross post to dev.to.  I did not like how they clashed and moved the text.   I also swapped over from gatsby fixed and gatsby fluid to make sure that the cover art always fits the card correctly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../2020-02-15%2009-36-31_Start.png\"></p>\n<h2>Feeling Inspired</h2>\n<p>Having gradients everywhere has been becoming very popular again.  Not the heavy highly saturated gradients from 00's presentation software. Gentle barely noticeable gradients, and soft gradients that flow smoothly from one color to the next.  So many splash screens and logos include these now.</p>\n<p>I have been really inspired by the <strong>sick</strong> lighting that has been hot on youtube and twitch lately.  As I was gearing up to re-design my cards I saw this post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi\" title=\"@chrisbiscardi on twitter\">@chrisbiscardi</a> and knew right then that I needed to do a similar lighting effect on my redesign!  This was literally my jumping off point at which I started the re-design.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../inspiration-for-new-post-card-2020-Chris-Biscardi.png\"></p>\n<h3>Shadows</h3>\n<p>For this step I did not use any tooling, though I found some that could have been helpful later.  I literally just started stacking up different colors of box shadow, pulling a big blur, shifting them around, and adjusting the color opacity until everything looks just right.  Again I went really subtle here, comparing back to Chris's backdrop I am a bit more subtle than even that.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token property\">box-shadow</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n   -8rem -6rem 8rem -6rem <span class=\"token function\">rgba</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>253<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 221<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 88<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> .2<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n   4rem 0 8rem <span class=\"token function\">rgba</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>88<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 82<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 185<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> .3<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n   .2rem .2rem 1rem <span class=\"token function\">rgba</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> .2<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Complete format</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../../new-post-card-2020.png\"></p>\n<h2>A few days too late</h2>\n<p>A few days later I saw this thread of tweets by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">@sarah_edo</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swyx\">@swyx</a> and realized that this style is called <strong>neomorphism</strong>.

These really sum up so much of what folks do within an office.  So many of us dabble in or become power users of spreadsheets without knowing there is an alternative out there that can save us time, automate boring things, and allow us to open up our minds for the part that we add value, Thinking about the data.</p>\n<h2>Focus on Value Add Operations</h2>\n<p>Lets face it, stitching together spreadsheets is zero value add by itself, but if you can see something in the data and take action on it, this can be huge value add to your company. Learning just a bit of python will help focus more of your attention on \"value add operations\" and leave the mundane stuff to your computer.</p>\n<h2>Merge a directory full of spreadsheets into one</h2>\n<p>I see this one all the time.  One team gets a spreadsheet from another team once per month and they need to stich all the pieces together.

It also takes time out of your day that you dont need to spend.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"python\"><pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> pandas <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> pd\n<span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> pathlib <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> Path\n\nfiles <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> Path<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>glob<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'raw/*.csv'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\ncsvs <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>pd<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>read_csv<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token builtin\">file</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">file</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> files<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\ncsvs_combined <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> pd<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>concat<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>csvs<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\ncsvs_combined<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>to_csv<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'processed/combined.csv'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Fetch data from a url</h2>\n<p>It might be possible that the other team shares their data on a website.  If you can get access to the data via a url, as in the example below there is no need to go to the website to save the data every week/month, you can have python do that for you.  It's very likely that you will need to combine this with step one in many workflows.  Now your data compiling can be done in one single running of a script.  Your data is still in a format that excel can read and you can stick with a hybrid workflow while you become comfortable in python.</p>\n<p>There is no shame in opening excel to do something in 5 minutes that would take an hour of research to do in python.  If you stick to it though, piece by piece everything will come together.  You will be able to do more in python than you could imagine in excel and you will wonder how you did it without the help of python.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"python\"><pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> pandas <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> pd\n\ncars_url <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'https://www.kaggle.com/abineshkumark/carsdata/download/xrvGk4JtQZJZetxwsCCy%2Fversions%2Fl2HR9tTLKz8MzHMAjBcl%2Ffiles%2Fcars.csv?datasetVersionNumber=1'</span>\ncars <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> pd<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>read_csv<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>cars_url<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\ncars<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>to_csv<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'cars.csv'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Fetch data from a database</h2>\n<p>This one can be a bit trickier, often requires hunting down tables that are undocumented. Getting access, and figuring out the crednetials.  If you can get over that hump though it is likely that you will have access to several data source that you typically use in one place.  From there you can learn how to join them together to create powerful workflows.</p>\n<p>SQL can be a very daunting language to learn but if you spend an hour with it you will know enough to at least get the data into python or excel.  You can continue to hone your sql skills and move more of your aggregation/analysis into the database for better performance.  If you are asking for 1M rows for a 10 row report the efficiency gains of doing that aggregation in the database and not sending 1M rows over the wire can be immense.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"python\"><pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> pandas <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> pd\n<span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> sqlalchemy <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> create engine\n\nengine <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> create_engine<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/mydatabase'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\nsql <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'select * from inventory'</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> engine<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>connect<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> connection<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    inventory <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> pd<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>read_sql<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>sql<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> con<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\nengine<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>dispose<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\ninventory<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>to_csv<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'cars'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Learning to automate has value</h2>\n<p>I often see folks joking that developers will spend 10 minutes to automate a 1 minute task that they will only ever do once.  There is definitely a limit to when your time is more valueable just doing the task and moving on, but as you hone your skills you will get much faster.</p>\n<p>Things that needed research slowly become intuitive.  Things that used to be brain twisting 50 lines can be an easy to read 12.</p>\n<p>Slowly you get better.</p>\n<p>Things that were unfeasible become part of your wheelhouse.</p>\n<p>Give value to the learning process of automating tasks.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/3-things-to-automate-with-python/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["python"],"title":"Three things to Automate with Python using Pandas","description":"Here are three things that I see my non programming counterparts doing every single day.
