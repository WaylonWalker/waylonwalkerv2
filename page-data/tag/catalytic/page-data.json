I often scan, then read.  If the article is really good or pertains well to me I will read everything, otherwise, I go back and read only the sections of interest.  If there are no discernable sections you lost me.</p>\n<p>For this reason, you need to break up your post, into sections and treat the heading for each one like you would a title of a full post.</p>\n<h3><abbr title=\"Table of Contents\">TOC</abbr></h3>\n<p><em>Table of Contents</em></p>\n<p>A lot of folks responded to Danny's post suggesting a table of contents.

I treat each heading as an article title.

This is the hardest to pull off in my opinion, but if done right it will land you at the top of the search for a long time, in the top 7, and potentially the top 1 for a given tag.</p>\n<p>I used to think that every post needed to be a super post that everyone would rave over.  I have found personally that attempting to do this makes it so I rarely post and way overthink them.  I need to at least make a cutoff time that the post is going to ship.</p>\n<p>This can also be the most frustrating, you have put all of your eggs in one basket.  If you don't title it right, post at the right time, share it at the right time, it might not take off like you had hoped.</p>\n<p>{% post helenanders26/sql-series-from-a-to-z-2pk9 %}</p>\n<p>@helenanders26 takes the 👑 as the queen of the superpost.  She is the first person who comes to mind when I think of this post type</p>\n<h2>single post</h2>\n<p>Your average post.  There are a lot of great techniques to making the average post great (some added above).  Sometimes they find traction, sometimes they don't.  I don't sweat if they don't.  I like posting shorter content as its achievable for me and my lifestyle.  I can always crosslink them and generate more views/discussion across them.</p>\n<p>{% post taillogs/how-to-write-a-good-blog-post-2eom %}</p>\n<p>@taillogs has a good article on his process to writing a good post.</p>\n<p>For those struggling to find what to write about, this is a great article from @swyx <a href=\"https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public-hack\">learn-in-public-hack</a></p>\n<h2>series</h2>\n<p>Using the <code class=\"language-text\">series</code> tag you can break super posts into smaller ones.  This puts fewer of your eggs in the same basket.  I typically start a series when I know that I am going to post about a single topic often, but don't have it all laid out.  I've been told for these to be really successful it needs a bit more pre-thought.</p>\n<p>I do notice that I get a bit of engagement back to older posts every time a new one is posted.  so this does help drive engagement by continuously pulling readers in.  I am not sure if its quite as good as a link, or liquid embed.  Keep in mind when doing this the series component will show the first 2 and the last two without clicking.  Make sure that the first two really count, they will likely get the most traffic benefit from the series.</p>\n<p>{% post waylonwalker/what-are-github-actions-1lhh %}</p>\n<p>I personally put a lot of my content into a series.  I don't think through the full series ahead of time very much.  I do it because it helps me organize and retrieve my thoughts.  I find it easier to get back to the post I want to reference if I can find the series it was part of.  I think of it as a tag that no one else can post to.</p>\n<h2>discussion</h2>\n<p>Posts just like this one, where the author leads the discussion with an intriguing question or comment but holds back on their opinion.  The key here is that the author should engage in the discussion, keep the discussion moving, and provide their thoughts here.</p>\n<p>Selfishly this is one of my favorite types of posts to make as I learn the most from them.</p>\n<p>{% post ben/how-do-you-identify-over-engineering-1oad %}</p>\n<p>@ben is the king of the <a href=\"https://dev.to/t/discuss\">#discuss</a> post.  He is able to get just the right titles that pull people in and generate quite large discussions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Post what you want to read</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day <strong>YOU</strong> are the most important component.  Post what you like to read, post what you are able to write.  If you struggle to wrap your head around concepts in small posts and have a talent at making rockstar super posts do that.  <strong>Do YOU</strong></p>","fields":{"slug":"/crush-dev-to-posts/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["catalytic","blog"],"title":"How to crush amazing posts on DEV","description":"Here are a few of my top tips to help make dev.to posts more readable, and drive better engagement.","templateKey":"blog-post","status":"published","date":"2020-08-07T05:00:00.000Z","cover":{"med_img":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","width":500,"height":210,"src":"/static/2c5331cc1e03f772830a1584092d79cf/46604/crush-dev-to-posts-xmas2020.png","srcSet":"/static/2c5331cc1e03f772830a1584092d79cf/46604/crush-dev-to-posts-xmas2020.png 1x,\n/static/2c5331cc1e03f772830a1584092d79cf/d8815/crush-dev-to-posts-xmas2020.png 1.5x,\n/static/2c5331cc1e03f772830a1584092d79cf/31987/crush-dev-to-posts-xmas2020.png 2x"}},"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","width":200,"height":85,"src":"/static/2c5331cc1e03f772830a1584092d79cf/71e30/crush-dev-to-posts-xmas2020.png","srcSet":"/static/2c5331cc1e03f772830a1584092d79cf/71e30/crush-dev-to-posts-xmas2020.png 1x,\n/static/2c5331cc1e03f772830a1584092d79cf/24123/crush-dev-to-posts-xmas2020.png 1.5x,\n/static/2c5331cc1e03f772830a1584092d79cf/492a0/crush-dev-to-posts-xmas2020.png 2x"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"d7b0bc17-2f9a-58ac-ac6a-4b788dd671fb","html":"<p><em>Based on an episode of react podcast.</em></p>\n<p>🎙 Listen to the full <a href=\"https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/episodes/103\">episode</a>.</p>\n<h2>So Inspirational</h2>\n<p>I was particularly inspired by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chantastic\">@chantastic</a> episode 103 of the react podcast with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParissAthena\">@ParissAthena</a>.  They spoke about the black tech pipeline as well as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  Pariss is quite an inspiration.  She has done so much work to create a better place for POC in tech.  I like that not only is she helping them get jobs but acting as a mentor for their first few months on the job to make sure that they are able to find their place and fit in.</p>\n<h2>Losing their culture</h2>\n<p>One thing that Michael brought up was the feeling he gets when he has other Asian friends to collaborate with at work is just a feeling of fitting in.  All too often he feels like he has to put on this persona of \"Hamburgers and Beer are my favorite thing, like all the time\" just to fit in.</p>\n<h2>Growing up in Rural America (me)</h2>\n<p>I grew up in a very rural part of the United States Dominated by Whites with a prominent Mexican community, there was almost no Asian or Black.  I can't tell you how many times I heard, \"I have this friend John, He's black, but he's not really black.\"  I will say that I was never quite this low, but growing up in a region where this was the norm, I probably wasn't the best ambassador either.</p>\n<p>Years later I recall taking some training for work that could not have described the people I grew up with better.  It described rural parts of the United States as completely accepting of any POC as long as they completely leave their culture behind.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I have this friend John, He's black, but he's not really black.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>I heard this statement far too many times coming from rural United States</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thinking a little bit more into this statement I realize that as a culture Rural America was very open to POC, but <strong>not</strong> <strong>at</strong> <strong>all</strong> open to their <strong>culture</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is where a lot of what we were taught in school in the '90s and '00s falls short.  We were so heavily focused on, <em>\" I don't see color\"</em>.  We were taught that race was all about color, having friends of color, and treating everyone equally.  But I think that not seeing color puts us in a situation of not really treating everyone equally.  Their color may have been seen as equal, but their culture wasn't.</p>\n<p>We have failed to embrace others the way we would want them to embrace us.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Hamburgers and Beer are my favorite thing, like all the time\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is where I really connected with Michael's statement \"Hamburgers and Beer are my favorite thing, like all the time\".  So often we can look past color, but we completely miss making a real connection with other cultures.</p>\n<h2>Welcome Everyone</h2>\n<p><em>Like, really welcome them.</em></p>\n<p>Further, into the episode, Pariss spoke about being hired into tech and feeling left out of the conversation because she didn't feel like she fit in.  She would hire in with a non-POC on the same day and felt like people would stare at her like a zoo animal while treating the other new hire as a real person.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>people would stare at her like a zoo animal</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Take Action</h2>\n<p>I know that I do not want to make anyone on my team feel like a zoo animal.  I feel like listening to this episode gave me a bit of perspective into what it might be like to be just a bit different than everyone else.  I really appreciate the both of them for being so open about sharing their experiences.  I will definitely think of ways that I can make any new hire just a bit more welcome next time.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For this post don't follow me on Twitter, don't join my newsletter.</p>\n<p>Share the episode with a friend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/episodes/103\">react podcast 103</a></p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParissAthena\">@ParissAthena</a></p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chantastic\">@chantastic</a></p>\n<p>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://blacktechpipeline.substack.com/p/coming-soon\">Black Tech Pipeline Newsletter</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Follow them they are some amazing people.</h2>\n<p>I have been trying to build out the content in mine.

They spoke about the black tech pipeline as well as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Pariss is quite an inspiration. She has done so much work to create a better place for POC in tech. I like that not only is she helping them get jobs but acting as a mentor for their first few months on the job to make sure that they are able to find their place and fit in.","templateKey":"blog-post","status":"published","date":"2020-08-03T05:00:00.000Z","cover":{"med_img":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","width":500,"height":210,"src":"/static/087b6776853c4388f1dfbfadf0592eea/46604/pariss-athena-on-black-tech-pipeline-xmas2020.png","srcSet":"/static/087b6776853c4388f1dfbfadf0592eea/46604/pariss-athena-on-black-tech-pipeline-xmas2020.png 1x,\n/static/087b6776853c4388f1dfbfadf0592eea/d8815/pariss-athena-on-black-tech-pipeline-xmas2020.png 1.5x,\n/static/087b6776853c4388f1dfbfadf0592eea/31987/pariss-athena-on-black-tech-pipeline-xmas2020.png 2x"}},"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","width":200,"height":85,"src":"/static/087b6776853c4388f1dfbfadf0592eea/71e30/pariss-athena-on-black-tech-pipeline-xmas2020.png","srcSet":"/static/087b6776853c4388f1dfbfadf0592eea/71e30/pariss-athena-on-black-tech-pipeline-xmas2020.png 1x,\n/static/087b6776853c4388f1dfbfadf0592eea/24123/pariss-athena-on-black-tech-pipeline-xmas2020.png 1.5x,\n/static/087b6776853c4388f1dfbfadf0592eea/492a0/pariss-athena-on-black-tech-pipeline-xmas2020.png 2x"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"99c2a99a-9200-597c-8f3d-26dea9fb8979","html":"<p>I ran a discussion on dev that collected quite a list of examples in the comment section.
