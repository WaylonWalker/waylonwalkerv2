Back in those days I was up before the sun every day... No Excuses.  I remember I would start asking to go to your house almost immediately when I woke up on weekends that I knew you had at your dad's.  Mom usually held me back until at least 10 AM before I was allowed to start knocking on the door.  At that point I would jump on my bike for the 1/4 mile trek down the gravel road, usually to find out that you were not quite up yet.  From there I would keep stopping by every 30 minutes until you were ready to play.  Which could only be in 30 minute increments... Do you remember that?  We had 30 minute curfew's to that we were allowed to play at each others house. At which point we would just ask to go play at the others house.</p>\n<p>I remember playing in the mudhole in front of my house chasing the tiniest frogs imaginable, to look behind and you had lost your boots completely stuck in the mud ready to loose your things.  I was full outdoors man back in those days.  Wanted to be just like dad.  Spending all of my free time riding my bike and chasing some sort of animal.  I would go back to help and get myself stuck.  By the end of it I'm sure we both had gone head first in the mud trying to get out!  At this point we were probably told that it was time to stop playing together for the day as we were both a complete wreck.  I'm sure that I was angry that I made it through on my own fine, only to get messy trying to help you.  In reality It was just about impossible to get through that mudhole if you weren't the first one through it.</p>\n<p>Years later our bikes turned to mopeds, three-wheelers, and go carts.  I have nearly forgotten about the go-carts by this point.  I remember that you always had this big BA oddessy, and It was all I could do to keep up on the grasshopper.  I remember desperately trying to keep up one day coming from our soon to be motocross track to Mark's house when I hit big hole sideways and went rolling.  I had no helmet on our anything.  I am pretty sure that I hurt myself pretty good, but I was too tough to let that stop me.  Besides that I was probably too proud of my amazing go-carting skills to even admit that I would have crashed.   By the time I caught up I just played it off like I needed a break.  Which would be completely obvious because there was nothing that made me want to take a break from riding back in those days.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Good Old Days","templateKey":"gratitude","date":"2019-09-22T16:55:19.000Z"}}},{"node":{"id":"07623040-a659-5a44-b23b-d902af7e3b45","html":"<h4>Happy Anniversary</h4>\n<p>Its been 8 great years so far.

As the years have gone by many of the folks I looked up to are gone or absent from the community.  I am finding others seeking my attention more and more.

The perfect amount to go frolicing in.  Not too much to make it difficult to walk, but enough to cover everything in sight.  In the Afternoon Wyatt and I mustered up the courage to brave our way through some nearby trails.  The adventure was exciting as we have not yet ventured these trails much since our move here.  The trail we chose approached a nearby stream.  We watched as the glassy smooth stream cut through the shear white snow, ran through the fluffy off white catails, and into the frozen lake.  We continued to walk onto a park, where we had a long snowball fight in which I stood back and through snowballs at wyatt as he ran through the park.  Wyatt won of course as it was nearly impossible to hit him as he dodged in and out of the equipment, and I would lose one point for each and every miss.  Soon thereafter the sun was quickly setting and it was time to hit the trail home.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gratitude 086","templateKey":"gratitude","date":"2019-02-15T00:00:00.000Z"}}},{"node":{"id":"065eb525-de30-58df-8eae-305df3f8dab1","html":"<h4>Oh the Love</h4>\n<p>Today is Valentines day, and I have been getting all sorts of love from my family, and it is really amazing.

It really reminded me of the difference I make in their lives every day.  Rhiannon remade a sign that we used to have haning in our house.

I am very grateful to say that today we not only do we have a good emergency fund in place, but we also have our last credit card paid off.  I cannot explain how great this feels.   We had stretched ourselves too thin and were using debt for emergencies for a few years, and it had gotten to the point that I felt like we were in an endless cycle that we could never get out of.</p>\n<p>This would not have been possible without the help of several folks.

Fighting  it only makes for starting off what could have been a good day on a bad note.  I let him go downstairs and he stayed quiet for the most part and let everyone sleep.  When I came down just before 6 he greeted me with cheer, let me have my coffee and we proceeded to have some special time.

The kids were so excited to see all of the gifts, and had such fun opening them.  They have been playing with them all day.  I am very grateful to see them sharing and having fun together rather than fighting over who gets what.  Wyatt has really been stepping it up as a big brother, and even spent his own hard earned money to buy Ayla a gift!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am very grateful to see them sharing and having fun together</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gratitude 011","templateKey":"gratitude","date":"2017-12-23T00:00:00.000Z"}}},{"node":{"id":"679ec179-40e0-546f-a0a0-04cab5c7a3d0","html":"<h4>Strong Relationships</h4>\n<p>A few months ago my wife and I decided to start going to family therapy, to talk about some things that we could see were only going to get worse without giving them some attention.  This is the best decision we have made in our marriage.  We have really learned to relate to the other person, and put ourself in their shoes.  We are learning about how our actions effect the other.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the best decision we have made in our marriage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Without taking steps in the right direction our marriage was heading downhill.  Medical needs were taking precidence, and we were both fighing through a dark hole of depression.  After the first session we saw great improvement.  I am grateful that we took the steps to work on our marriage in such a dark time for us on every other aspect of life.  I am grateful that we got a great therapist on first try.  I feel like you rarely get a medical professional that works for you on the first try.  I am grateful that we are both devoted to making it work, and have made great strides in our relationship.  Most of all I am grateful to see how taking the right steps to strengthen our marriage has improved other parts of our life, and made it easier to handle events as they come up.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gratitude 010","templateKey":"gratitude","date":"2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z"}}},{"node":{"id":"f5fb69e1-672f-57ec-a021-88e08baa516d","html":"<h4>One on One time</h4>\n<p>Last night we made a long trip back from my In-Laws.  Which was a great day by the way.  Sometimes we struggle with Wyatt's energy in a house with lots of breakable items, but he did great yesterday.  When we got home Wyatt just finished up with a good two hour nap and was wired... at 11:00 PM.  He was hungry, as he was too excited to play while at grandmas house and did not eat much.  I sat up with him,  we shared a peanut butter sandwich and got out a new pack of trolls characters and worked on finding all of their names.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we got home Wyatt just finished up with a good two hour nap and was wired... at 11:00 PM</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moments like these do not seem to come often enough.

It was a rough day, she had a bad carcinoid attack last night and was on edge of another all day today.  I am grateful that we were able to get in with a really good oncologist.  The best in the area in terms of carcinoid cancer.  I am really glad that he has a plan for us and it is helping get through most of the month between doses.  Since it is such a rare type of cancer there are few knowledgeable in the subject, which just makes it that much better that we are in with the best.   It allows us to have some really good days.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gratitude 009","templateKey":"gratitude","date":"2017-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2992646504"]}
