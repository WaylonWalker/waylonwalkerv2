#### Getting out of the house

The morning is early as I open the door and am greated with the fresh skif of snow.  The perfect amount to go frolicing in.  Not too much to make it difficult to walk, but enough to cover everything in sight.  In the Afternoon Wyatt and I mustered up the courage to brave our way through some nearby trails.  The adventure was exciting as we have not yet ventured these trails much since our move here.  The trail we chose approached a nearby stream.  We watched as the glassy smooth stream cut through the shear white snow, ran through the fluffy off white catails, and into the frozen lake.  We continued to walk onto a park, where we had a long snowball fight in which I stood back and through snowballs at wyatt as he ran through the park.  Wyatt won of course as it was nearly impossible to hit him as he dodged in and out of the equipment, and I would lose one point for each and every miss.  Soon thereafter the sun was quickly setting and it was time to hit the trail home.
