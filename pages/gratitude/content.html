<h4 id="pick-me-up-when-i-fall">Pick me up when I Fall</h4>
<p>Lately there has been a rollar coaster running through our house. So much going on that its hard for everyone ot keep their head above water at all times. I am grateful that we all have remained on each others team. Sometimes when we fall we have to help ourselves back up, but it is really nice when there are others there to help us up. That’s what family is for isn’t it? It is amazing to see how others respond when they see you down and jump in with all they can do to help. I recently had a fall (<em>mental</em>), and after getting through it felt rediculous. It has really opened my eyes to how to help people, and how to spot someone who is just having a rough day. Most people do not have poor intentions, but they can come off that way when they are in a bad place. Spot these moments in someones day and try to pick them back up. ### Gratitude 057</p>

<p>Lately I have been feeling great! Literally great. We have had a ton going on for awhile and its been a long time that I have truely felt this great. The benefits are astounding. They say that you can only help others when you are capable of helping yourself, <em>oh how that is so true</em>. I feel like lately I have been able to keep my cool and help everyone else much better than when not feeling on top of my game.</p>

<h4 id="reflection">Reflection</h4>
<p>Today is Thanksgiving here in the United States, what a great day to take a reflection on the past year, and think about what I am grateful for.</p>
<p>Ayla is a singing, speaking, yelling, and screeeeeming pro. Over this last year she has gone from nearly mute to graduating from Speech therapy! Her progress has been astounding, and seeing her now you would have no idea where she was one year ago. I would say she has some of the best enunciation I have heard from a 4 year old.</p>
<p>Wyatt got his CPAP, and has a plan to help him start sleeping better. We are all hoping for the best for this little boy. Fingers crossed that some sleep will help his ADHD.</p>
<p>I am also very grateful for where our marriage is and where it has came from over the last year. It has been rocky, but what relationship isn’t <em>we’re people</em>. But we have learned so much about each other, and continue to get better each and every day. I think that it’s pretty amazing that we can take everything that life throws at us and stay on top!.</p>

<h4 id="signs-of-improvement">Signs of Improvement</h4>
<p>Ayla was born 4 years ago with her fair share of medical issues. Most of which are resolved… potty training continues to be a source of difficulty for us. We have relaxed and are letting her take the wheel at the moment. It is slow going, but every once in awhile she shows us a spark of hope that she will get it. Yesterday was one of those days. It is good to continue to let these moments revive our hope that she can do it and that when we are ready to push her again she will be ready to take charge.</p>

<h4 id="hanging-in-there">Hanging in there…</h4>
<p>Through everything we have gone through we have always came out on top. Nothing has knocked us down so bad that we cannot get back up. Some days it may feel like we will never recover, but we always do. Some days everything just is too much and is too overwhelming, but we find our way to the top. Some days we feel crushed, but somehow we find the strength to kick that boulder off of our chest and rise above. We are human, we have our good days and out bad days. Our bad days feel so low we think it may never end, but it always does. We rise back to the top and crush this thing we call life. Everyone has their own struggles that they deal with every day, and their own battles to fight. Next time your down, just remember it will <strong>not</strong> last forever and your day will come to crush it. We will stand strong, concour our enemies, and rise to the top.</p>

<p>We recently <em>(today)</em> found out that that Wyatt has moderatly severe Sleep apnea. This explains a lot for him, and is a bit scary for us at the moment, and we are hoping for the best for him. We wouldnt have found out any of this if it wasnt for Rhiannon. She is an advocate for these kids like nothing else. The mom gene is strong wiht this one. When she knows something is wrong in her gut, she stops at nothing to find answers.</p>

<p>The past 6 years have taught me a lot about life. Especially about the most important part <strong>Family</strong>. Family are those who have your back at any moment, and you have their back at any given moment. 6 years ago we expanded our family when we brought our first child into it. Since then has been quite the journey. Throughout those 6 years every single one of use have had our ups and downs, but the others always have our backs and help us through anything. Not only is that sweet boy turning 6 today, but he is the one that needs a bit of extra attention right now. We have his back and will help him through his journey.</p>

<h4 id="talking">Talking</h4>
<p>Today I am grateful for the fact that I have someone to talk about my problems with. Rhiannon is very influential when it comes to mental health. She has conconcoured several very difficult issues of her own and is able to guide me through mine. I am glad that we are able to talk through these things and come up with actionable things to correct.</p>
<p>Life remains a rollar coaster and these issues will come and go, new ones will rise and fall, old ones will creep in. It is important to keep someone like this who you can talk to. For me it is <strong>very</strong> difficult to identify what the root issue is to begin with let alone try to fix it. Recently I was really struggling and it came down to confidence/imposter syndrome. She was able to identify that, and point out some really amazing feedback that I have recieved as truth that I am achieving great standards, even if I dont feel that way when I am lost in the weeds of everything.</p>

<p>Today was Ayla’s fourth birthday, what an adventure it took to get here. I am so grateful for how far she has came. Her medical issues are all resolved, her speech is on point, and she is overall a very happy and healthy four year old girl. Today we were able to celebrate her birthday at home as a family. She absolutely loved the presents that we got her. It was very fun to watch the excitement on her face all day long. She is very attached to her new toys and hasnt stopped playing with them yet. It has been a long journey for us to get here with us, and it was worth all of the effort!</p>

<p>Today I woke up to find a very inspiring note from Rhiannon. It was hand writtent front and back! In the note she talked about the stuggles that we have had over the last 2 years, and that while reading through her journal there was one thing that kept her going day in and day out, me. I have been there through the hard times for her. Yesterday I heard some news that was very sad for me to hear, and made me very unsure of the future. She left me this note to let me know that no matter what happens she will be there by my side and we will get through it together.</p>

<p>Today We had a playdate for the kids. While its good to get the kids out and interacting with others, its good for the adults as well. I am not typically one to spring up an event with other adults, so its great that the kids drive that for us. The adults were able to play a board game while the kids were playing. I am very grateful that I was able to get out and enjoy some time with other adults, and that the kids had a really good afternoon. The game we played was new to me and was a blast to play.</p>

<h4 id="bravery">Bravery</h4>
<p>Its not something that is handed out by participation. Being part of the battle does not earn bravery. Defeating the odds, going into a battle with passion for the end result, and putting all of your heart into it. Thats what defines bravery to me. Last night I saw two family members give excelent examples of bravery. Last night was the preschool prom night. Ayla was unable to go, and Rhiannon was very passionate about going with Wyatt. She has not been feeling well, and being around lots of poeple can make it very difficult at times, but she did it. She was able to overcome the odds and make it through the prom for him. The other great example of bravery was Wyatt. While in a very excited mood, with a lot going on around him. He was able to stand by his mothers side, hold her hand, ask her if she was ok, and ask if there was anything he could do to help her through a rough spot. He was able to overcome his ADHD, take a deep breath and stand strong for his mother. This is not the first time that he has done this. He has been growing up into a brave boy lately.</p>

<p>Yesterday Rhiannon and I were able to get some much needed time away for some very overdue haircuts. It was really nice to be able to just take off and leave the kids with friends on a whim. While it takes all that she’s got to go anywhere I am still very grateful that she is able to get out of the house. It was nice to spend a dreary day out with her. Dreary days are the best because the air is always fresh and clear of most environmental smoke.</p>

<h4 id="running">Running</h4>
<p>Over the course of the winter the kids and I have been creating trails through the woods behind our house. It has been really fun. The forrest is really thick with lots of small bits of brush, a stream, logs and various old junk. The kids have enjoyed having a place to get out of the house and stop around. It has been a great outlet for us.</p>
<p>Recently I have started running on them. I have been getting better and better. I feel like I am starting to get back inot a bit of shape where I am not winded within minutes, but can at least make a few laps. I find the trails really fun to run on, as I have always really struggled running on a track or even sidewalk. I am always looking for something to make it more exciting.</p>

<p>I have recently found a new podcast, The Ken Coleman Show, from the Ramsey network. I really like Ken’s style. He recently talked about 2 two things that you should do everyday. Prepare and reflect. If you are not doing these things it is very difficult to progress in your goals. I really like how the gratitude journal works into the reflect piece of life. It brings me positivity and a chance to look back on the day. I like how I am able to reflect on the day, or last few days and find something positive that happened. It also helps me think about how I can improve myself. I am also reflecting throughout the day as I think about things that I might write about in the journal.</p>

<p>Today I am very grateful for all of the wonderful birthday wishes. I started off the day with two very excited kids. They couldn’t wait to wake up, give daddy a big hug and wish him happy birthday today. My kids love them some birthday wishes and do all they can to make the birthday person feel special. Next the text messages started to roll in. It is nice to hear from everyone that I havent heard from in awhile. At night Scott Volunteered to bathe the kids, and get pajammas on them, while I was able to spend a bit more time with Rhiannon. Speaking of which…</p>
<p>I didnt forget the most special of all. Rhiannon, my beautiful wife, was a soldier today. She got up, forgone the medicine, and headed out with me bright and early to take the kids to Pre-K, get coffee, and run various errands. In which we ran into smoke on several occassions that nearly took her down. While I was out taking Wyatt to therapy, and picking up Ayla. She muscled through and finished my quilt, wrapped my presents, and cooked an amazing jumbalya!!</p>
<p>All in all this was one of the best days I have had in awhile, Thanks everyone!</p>

<h4 id="i-slept-in">I slept in</h4>
<p>Today has been a really relaxing day! I woke up this morning Rhiannon was with Ayla, and Wyatt was downstairs with some friends staying in the house, so I continued sleeping until I was ready to get up. After getting up I helped Ayla with potty training for awhile, in which we racked up 3 sticker! Then Wyatt and I went out sledding in this epic snow that we were blessed with today. It was a thick heavy, and perfect sledding snow. We built a tall takeoff ramp, and continued sledding for quite awile. It was a bit tiring from the weight of the snow, but it was super fun. The reason that I say that we were blessed with this snow is that the fires have stopped. Every trip we leave the house this past week has ended up with us running into a thick smoke from folks burning grass and brush. This landed us in the hospital once, and Rhiannon in strong pain the other times. ### Gratitude #0040 <em>2018-03-18 11:05:51 Waylon Walker</em></p>
<h4 id="no-more-credit-cards">No More Credit Cards</h4>
<p>Let’s face it we all know that credit cards are bad and we should not let them get out of control, but you know what life happens and when you dont have an emergency fund in order using one is better than being stranded with a broken car, or missing out on a very important family event. I am very grateful to say that today we not only do we have a good emergency fund in place, but we also have our last credit card paid off. I cannot explain how great this feels. We had stretched ourselves too thin and were using debt for emergencies for a few years, and it had gotten to the point that I felt like we were in an endless cycle that we could never get out of.</p>
<p>This would not have been possible without the help of several folks. First off Rhiannon, as if you are not on the same page as your wife with finances, you will never fix your financial problems. Second Dave Ramsey for showing us the light. And finally our friends who have supported us more than we can even thank them for.</p>

Most of all I was really proud of all fo the work that Rhiannon has done to set up for the future. The meeting with Leis confirmed that she has done everything possible to set up for success. She had an answer for all of his questions, and had everything setup that he suggested. Her organizational skills have really paid off. I have a really good feeling that we are as well prepared as we can be and on track to succeed in the future. Thank you Leis for your time! It is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I cannot express how grateful I am for Rhiannon’s smarts when it comes to raising small children. These things are complicated and only continue to get more complicated as they grow! There are times where I am just not quite sure what to do or how to handle certain situations, and she will come back with an answer that makes sense. Giving an understanding about how that would make the child feel in the moment and what it will do to them in the long term. As I am growing these understandings things are making more sense, but I still feel like I have a lot to learn when it comes to parenting. I am not only grateful that she takes the lead on the research and develops new strategies as they grow, but she is also able to present to me in a way that makes sense.</p>

<p>This morning Wyatt came into our room just as normal, chipper as can be ready to go. But something was different than normal. I felt like I had just hit the pillow. I grabbed a phone so that he could go watch something on his own, when I relized that it was 2:30AM. This is not out of the ordinary for him to have a few days that he is ready to go. We have learned that this is part of his ADHD and his mind is just running and ready to go. Fighting it only makes for starting off what could have been a good day on a bad note. I let him go downstairs and he stayed quiet for the most part and let everyone sleep. When I came down just before 6 he greeted me with cheer, let me have my coffee and we proceeded to have some special time. We build with magnet tiles, legos, played a game, and even went outside to continue carving our path through the woods. I cherish our special time together in happiness and am glad that we are learning to work with his disorder and have more good days like this.</p>

As I am sitting here with a nice display of color and listening to the frogs, from our kids’s lighted sound machine of course. I realize that I am just enjoying this moment of peace. It is nice to not have to worry about anything for a few minutes and just let the words flow. I think this is why I enjoy doing this gratitude journal, becuase I feel a nice sense of peace after completeing it for the day. Sometimes the days are crazy, sometimes they are normal, sometimes they are quiet each day is new and none like the other. But whatever the day brings most of them have included this 5 minutes of peace for the last 35 days. Thank you Rhiannon for pushing me to start this journal.</p>

Since Rhiannon got the January mug at Starbucks we have been stopping there for the morning coffee on the way to preschool. As we were leaving a police car came roaring from the parking lot lights on right behind us. There was an accident at the intersection right in front of Starbucks. Passing by the accident it clearly looked like one car took more damage than the other, and that it was from being hit by another car and pushed into a pole at a high speed. My heart goes out to them! It made me really grateful that we have not been in any accidents, especially because we typically drive down a very crazy road in the mornings. It is not uncommon to come accross accidents along the way.</p>

<p>On Thursday I got the call that Rhiannon had passes out during physical therapy. I went right to her therapy office to find her rehydrating in a chair. She seemed ok and that this would pass and be ok. When trying to get up again she passed out. Three days later we are back home from the hospital and she is still passing out. All we know is that she has cancer and she is struggling to keep her blood pressure up while standing. I am very grateful that we have the friends we have to take care of everything at home for us. Most of all I am grateful that we are able to keep it calm and collected. Too many folks get very worked up through these events and it is not productive. Our job is to remain calm, stay focused on the things that we are able to do that help her, and let the doctors do their job. We have enough doctors involved that if there was something to find, it would have been found. I really hope that we can get her back on her feet where she is not passing out everytime that she stands up. But for now, I am keeping my calm, staying positive, spending time with the kids, and doing the tasks that help us function through the day.</p>

I am so proud of Rhiannon for being able to hold this persons hand, and walk her to a better place in life.</p>

<h4 id="support-2">Support</h4>
<p>Over the past few years we have recieved tons of support from other people. This is something that I am very grateful for and we would not be where we are today without it. Along our journey we have came in contact with some very generous folks. Yesterday was our opportunity to give a little back to another. One of Rhiannon’s close friends boyfriends had passed away. While we did not know him very well, he meant a whole lot to someone who means a whole lot to us. I am very grateful that we were able to take the day off and make the long trip in good health.</p>

<p>This year I started a new position at work. Everything about it is enjoyable. Not sure if that is jut the honeymoon phase or not. I am working as a data scientist. Its exciting that there is so much low hanging fruit to be had. In my previous role as an engineer I was in a very established role. While this role was great, I really enjoyed it, and had no intentions of moving until this oppotunity landed in my lap. I felt like being in such an establishd role the job was to follow the processes that had been previously set up. Now being in a much less established role there is a lot more room for creativity. I like getting to work and really being excited to get to work creating things that add value to the organization.</p>

<h4 id="kid-time">Kid Time</h4>
<p>Sometimes you just need some time to be a kid. Today was that day… it was a snow day. During which the kids were very generous at letting me work, but we were also able to have some quality moments. First of which happened at lunch. Wyatt decided that we were having pancakes, and the kids would help make them. I was really impressed at their cooperation. They did really well at taking turns putting ingredients into the batter, and stirring.</p>

<p>The second bit of kid time came late in the afternoon after the kids had a nap. We went outside to go sledding. They were both a bit crabby to get clothes on, but cheered up once we got outside. We all had a blast, Even Ayla who has had a terrible fear of the snow this year. She just stood in it for the longest time before warming up to it. Eventually she braved up enough, aka was forced on to the sled with daddy. She loved it! She was absolutely smiling ear to ear when we hit the bottom. From there on the kids took turns riding down with daddy for the next 2 hrs!</p>

<h4 id="adult-time">Adult Time</h4>
<p>There is something special about having pure uninterrupted adult time with your spouse. Last night I went out with Rhiannon and we had an absolute blast. We went to the brand new brewery in town “Industry Brewing Company”. It was absolutely amazing. The food was good, but the beer was completely flawless. There is just something beautiful about something that is so flawless. Each style I had was brewed to a T. My favorite of course was the “Industry Standard”, a super hoppy pale ale.</p>
<p>Next we were off to the local big box quilting store to get some supplies for Rhiannon’s next project on Cuttin Scrap. It was fun, we looked at a bunch of different stuff. And she was able to talk shop.</p>
<p>After that we were off to see the latest Pitch perfect movie. before we were able to do that I required coffee to stay up through the whole thing. So we went downtown to check out Zion coffee roasters for the first time. It was a beautiful shop that reminded me of Horizon Line Coffee in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. We finished the night off in the movies and headed home.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to be able to spend such quality time with my best friend. We have great friends that are able to watch the crazy kids. We are able to afford a simple night out. Lastly Rhiannon and I are getting closer than we ever have before.</p>

<h4 id="good-tunes">Good Tunes</h4>
<p>Recently the kids have really been into singing in the car with Daddy on the way to and from Preshool. It is so fun, because we are all belting it out so loud, and each take over for our special parts. It’s interesting how Ayla has grown into liking it. For the longest time I thought that she did not like Wyatt and I being so loud, but she never complained about it. Then over the past week I noticed during some parts of the songs she is the <strong>LOUDEST</strong> one in the car. After each song the kids both ask, “Did I sing the whole song?”, and I try to get super into it and have a very motivational Radio DJ style of voice encouraging them to continue and tell them how well they did.</p>

<p>Last night stared like any other night. Put the kids to bed, hang out with my Beautiful wife for a while, off to sleep, then Wyatt comes in at the wee hours of the morning ready to start his day. The only difference last night was that it was not the wee hours of the day, it was <strong>11:30 PM</strong>. He was wired and ready to go as if he slept the whole night through. I am very grateful that I was able to tag team the situation with Rhiannon, as he did not go back to sleep. We were both able to get some rest through the night. It may not have been the best, but we were able to make the best out of a tough situation. In the Morning we had to take the van into the repair shop, and on the way home we were able to discuss some solutions to the problem when it happens in the future. Rhiannon was able to get the ball rolling with the pediatrician to see their recommendations. Man I love her, long before I would have even thought to go that route she had already sent the message out.</p>

<h4 id="my-first-french-braid">My First French Braid</h4>
<p>Tonight was the last night of the big holiday vacation and I finally got that special moment with every single family member over break. It was Ayla’s turn tonight. We had our break when Wyatt wanted mommy to play MineCraft with him and did not want daddy to play. Ayla’s hair looked like a bird was trying to built its nest in it. We made our way upstairs with a spray bottle, comb, brush and a whole lot of excitement. We filled the spray bottle with water, and I let Ayla start going to town spraying everything in sight. Although it was explicitly stated that it would not be used for its intended purpose, detangling hair. Thats ok though as I was able to get some moisture in with my hands. I continued to do my first french braid on her. The first attempt was a fail as Ayla was moving too much and I lost it. The second attemt was a success. After this Ayla proceeded to water, brush, wipe, and comb daddy’s har over the next hour!</p>
<p>I ran out of time, but I will still mention that she painted her first set of toes.</p>

<p>Breaks are a good time for refresh and focus on some other things. During this holiday break I have been able to spend quite a bit of time with my beautiful wife Rhiannon. I have really enjoyed helping her setup her new adventure <a href="www.cuttinscrap.com">Cuttin Scrap</a>. It will be a nice creative outlet for her to combine her love of sewing and crafting with her love of speech and writing. I am really excited to see her get going.</p>
<p>We have also spent some time at nights playing games and watching YouTube. Its really nice to not have to worry about anything work related and focus on the family. The extra time has helped strengthen our marriage and allow us to discuss some things that have been on our minds for awhile. Now its time to start 2018 Fresh and Strong.</p>

<p>Last night we made a long trip back from my In-Laws. Which was a great day by the way. Sometimes we struggle with Wyatt’s energy in a house with lots of breakable items, but he did great yesterday. When we got home Wyatt just finished up with a good two hour nap and was wired… at 11:00 PM. He was hungry, as he was too excited to play while at grandmas house and did not eat much. I sat up with him, we shared a peanut butter sandwich and got out a new pack of trolls characters and worked on finding all of their names.</p>

<p>Moments like these do not seem to come often enough.

<h4 id="special-moments">Special Moments</h4>
<p>I love having those special moments of time with the kids. Today we had a few minutes to play before supper time, and we decided to go down to the basement to play some imagination action adventure game. The kids are really into minecraft at the moment so its always very centered around minecraft. Tonight there was an extra special moment where Wyatt on his own gave Ayla his brand new nerf gun to play with. At this point he has not alowed her to play with it because it was a new Christmas toy. She was extatic, and we all enjoyed running from her as she shot towards us. I thought it was extra special because we were all having fun and no one was arguing about who got the new toy. I am so proud of Wyatt, because he is really growing up and growing out of the not sharing phase. I have really seen him open up to share an play with Ayla in new ways lately. It really makes you feel like a good parent when you can watch them grow up like this.</p>

<p>This Christmas we had two events on Christmas day, with 5 hours of travel, and a final destination to sleep at. I am very grateful that we were able to get through all of the travel in one piece. THe kids had a blast! It was a very fun Christmas for them. Wyatt got his most wished for gift this year, Maui’s hook from Moana. It was so fun to watch him open it. He was absolutely speechless.</p>
<p>I am glad everyone was able to enjoy the food. Both events were very accomodating to our family allergies. The first event was a potato bar where everything was kept separate and you could personalize your dish. The kids really just wanted to snack all day. At the second event they went out of their way to find dairy free butter to cook wtih. There were only one or two items that had dairy in them. It feels good to be supported by your family.</p>

<p>Today was one of those days. I spent much of the day helping Rhiannon set up the Cuttin Scrap channel. We are setting up a really nice area for her to work on a craft that she is very passionate about. It is the place that she has dreamed of for years. No its not perfect with the most space available, but it is the best with what we have got, and it is all hers. At the end of the day we were able to sit down and begin working through her website and socials.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed getting to play in the fresh snow with Wyatt. He loved it. We shoveled it into big piles to jump in, threw snowballs, and just had the best of adventure. Ayla and Rhiannon came to the window to watch, and they laughed at us while we acted silly. Today was Christmas, one of the most magical days of the year to spend with the ones you love most.</p>

We all got some really nice gifts, and I am glad that everyone was able to at least get something that they enjoy, even if it wasn’t much. The kids were so excited to see all of the gifts, and had such fun opening them. They have been playing with them all day. I am very grateful to see them sharing and having fun together rather than fighting over who gets what. Wyatt has really been stepping it up as a big brother, and even spent his own hard earned money to buy Ayla a gift!</p>

We are learning about how our actions effect the other.</p>

After the first session we saw great improvement. I am grateful that we took the steps to work on our marriage in such a dark time for us on every other aspect of life. I am grateful that we got a great therapist on first try. I feel like you rarely get a medical professional that works for you on the first try. I am grateful that we are both devoted to making it work, and have made great strides in our relationship.

I have started this journal, drinking keytones, tracking goals, keeping up with email, trello, using pomodoro, and started working out. All of these steps are giving me strength to keep a positive attitude through a very rough time in our life.

The one thing that I have struggled with since our move is being productive at home. The new house is a completely different environment than I am used to. There are lots of distractions and <strong>SLOW</strong> internet. The internet speed is so slow that I tend to get distracted and do other things when something that is usually executed within a few ms takes 30s or more. I know it sounds rediculous but when every step takes this much extra time it gets very distracting. It is something that I just need to learn to work with, and keep a project ready to work with little to no internet at all times.</p>

<p>Restarting each day is important for a very healthy attitude. Having a son with ADHD there are times where we need to restart each hour on a new foot. His mind runs at such a faster pace than everyone else’s that is can be hard to keep up with him. Sometimes we have meltdowns. It is very important to be able to coach him through it, present him with a resolution, and walk away. It is very hard as an adult to quickly bring down your emotions form a very high stress situation, but it is important for him to avoid going right back into another meltdown. Our family is very good at restarting each day on a new foot and not holding grudges against each other. This keeps us very strong through such hard times.</p>

I am glad to live in a family where we can talk about anything, and support each other through almost anything as well, though we aren’t afraid to point out each others dumb ideas if something really seems off. There is also the physical part of family. We are able to share some of the workloads. Today we had some extra family in the house and it was nice to have a few minutes here and there that I could get away and know that someone would take care of the kids if they needed something.</p>

<h4 id="time-off">Time Off</h4>
<p>I am currently in the middle of a week long holiday break. Its nice to take some time off from the everyday hustle to refresh the brain and focus on some other things. We are able to do quite a bit of traveling and see family that we do not get to see very often. I am able to spend more time with my wife and the kids. I have also started making a website for my wife. Its probably something that I would not otherwise have time to dig deeply into and make nearly the same progress as quickly.</p>
<p>The time in the car can be a nice time to connect. We have taken quite a bit of time to plan out Rhiannon’s new adventure, CuttinScrap. It is a YouTube channel that will serve as her creative outlet, combining her love of speech and Drama with Crafting. I am really excited to see her find her voice and get into a rhythm with the channel. She is really excited as well. We have been doing a lot of planning and behind the scenes work and anxiously awaiting time to make episode 0.</p>
