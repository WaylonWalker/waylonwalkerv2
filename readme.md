<h1 align="center">Gatsby's default starter
</h1>Kick off your project with this default boilerplate ([live demo](https://gatsby-starter-default-demo.netlify.com/)). This barebones starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need.

*Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/).*

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**
Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

``` sh
# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
npx gatsby new my-default-starter
```

2. **Start developing.**
Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

``` sh
cd my-default-starter/
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**
Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
*Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*
Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

```
.
├── node_modules
├── src
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierrc
├── gatsby-browser.js
├── gatsby-config.js
├── gatsby-node.js
├── gatsby-ssr.js
├── LICENSE
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── yarn.lock
```

1. <b>`/node_modules`</b>: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.
2. <b>`/src`</b>: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.
3. <b>`.gitignore`</b>: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.
4. <b>`.prettierrc`</b>: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.
5. <b>`gatsby-browser.js`</b>: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.
6. <b>`gatsby-config.js`</b>: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).
7. <b>`gatsby-node.js`</b>: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.
8. <b>`gatsby-ssr.js`</b>: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.
9. <b>`LICENSE`</b>: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.
10. <b>`package-lock.json`</b> (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
11. <b>`package.json`</b>: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
12. <b>`README.md`</b>: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
13. <b>`yarn.lock`</b>: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager alternative to npm. You can use either yarn or npm, though all of the Gatsby docs reference npm. This file serves essentially the same purpose as `package-lock.json`, just for a different package management system.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

* **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.
* **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the *Guides*, *API Reference*, and *Advanced Tutorials* sections in the sidebar.
