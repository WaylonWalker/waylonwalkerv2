   <h4>
    Recognition from unexpected places
   </h4>
   <p>
    Today I got a meeting invite with two folks that I do not usually get to interact with.  The title, recognition for Waylon Walker... I am very excited to see what it is, and very grateful to have the chance to meet these folks in person.  I do a lot of work that is not necessarily fit my job role, but is something that I know I have skills to do very quickly that many other folks do not.  I fill many of these requests throughout the year, and every once in awhile I get a VERY nice thank you from the person, or their boss.  I am grateful to be able to interact with these positive folks.  It makes me feel really good, and like I am doing a good job.  This particular on is different, and I will not know exactly what it is until Monday.
