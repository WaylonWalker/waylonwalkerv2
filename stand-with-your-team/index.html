   <h2>
    Building Steam
   </h2>
   <p>
    While collaborating on any project there are going to be decisions made that
aren't necessarily your favorite, during a summer internship my mentor made
some decisions that I was not on board with, but I accepted his wisdom and
moved forward with little push back.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Full Spead Ahead
   </h2>
   <p>
    During a review, leadership showed interest in the option that I wanted to go
towards.  I was quick to jump up and say I  told you so right then and there
and pitch reasons why my idea was so much better.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Aftermath
   </h2>
   <p>
    I walked out so
    <strong>
     proud
    </strong>
    that leadership recognized my idea, but I will never
forget the look on my teammate's face and what he told me after the meeting.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     "Wow quick to throw me under the bus in front of everyone ðŸ˜¢".   I
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    ~ my teammate
   </p>
   <h2>
    Realizing what Happened
   </h2>
   <p>
    It was at this moment that I threw my mentor, a good
    <strong>
     friend
    </strong>
    in front of a
bus that was at full speed.  I will never forget this moment and the importance
of being a good trustworthy team player.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Speak your Mind, be heard, shut up
   </h2>
   <p>
    This day I learned that there is a time to speak your mind.  While that bus is
sitting idle it would have hurt no one.
   </p>
   <hr/>
   <p>
    There were times to hear out ideas, and there were times that we need to accept
the decisions the team made.  The team that you were a part of and had a chance
to steer.
   </p>
   <hr/>
   <p>
    There are times where it's appropriate to sit down and shut up.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Your Story ðŸ‘‡
   </h1>
   <p>
    Do you have a story of how not standing with your team caused you pain later
on.  I would love to hear and learn from your experience.
