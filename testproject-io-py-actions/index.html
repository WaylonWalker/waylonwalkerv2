   <h2>
    ü§î What to test first?
   </h2>
   <p>
    The very first thing that comes to my mind is anything that is loaded or ran client-side.  Two things quickly came to mind here.  I run gatsby so most of my content is statically rendered, and it yells at me if something isn't as expected.  For performance reasons I lazy load cards on my blogroll, loading all of the header images gets heavy and kills lighthouse (if anyone actually cares). I am also loading some information from the top open-source libraries that I have created.  To prevent the need to rebuild the whole site to get the latest information I am just using the GitHub API client-side.
   </p>
   <p>
    things I was looking for from features to test
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     client-side interactions
    </li>
    <li>
     external API
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    features on my blog to consider testing
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     lazy-loaded blog cards
    </li>
    <li>
     GitHub Repos
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Repo Cards
   </h2>
   <p>
    I chose to start with the GitHub repos as they seemed a bit more straight forward, and it's been a while since I have done any selenium.

   <p>
    I am trying out
    <a href="https://TestProject.io">
     TestProject.io
    </a>
    for the first time on this project.  My experience so far has been top-notch.  There was an existing suite of docker images/files set up to run the TestProject agent in a docker container alongside headless chrome and firefox drivers.  The first thing that you are going to need is a
    <a href="https://app.TestProject.io/#/integrations/sdk">
     TP_DEV_TOKEN
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://app.TestProject.io/#/integrations/api">
     TP_API_KEY
    </a>
    .  These will give TestProject access to your account so that it can automatically post results to your
    <a href="https://app.TestProject.io/#/reports">
     dashboard
    </a>
   </p>
   <ul>

    In your GitHub repo go to
    <code>
     settings&gt;Secrets
    </code>
    , or append
    <code>
     settings/secrets
    </code>
    to the URL to your repo, and add the tokens.  This will give GitHub safe access to them without them being available to the public, contributors, log files, or anything.

   <h2>
    Setup Dev
   </h2>
   <p>
    To expedite development I went ahead and set up development environment that I could log into on Digital Ocean.  This allowed me to get all of my tests working a bit quicker than just running them through GitHub, but being as similar as possible.  This allowed me to learn the ins and outs of setting up TestProject without needing to do a full install every time through Github's actions.

    I chose to go down the route of using pytest.  I really liked the idea of utilizing fixtures, automatically running my test functions, and utilizing a bit of the pytest reporting capabilities.

    <strong>
     NOTE
    </strong>
    per pytest standard practice I named the directory containing tests
    <code>
     tests
    </code>
    .  While this works, TestProject.io uses this director as the default name for the project.  If I were to go back I would either rename the directory to what I want to show up on TestProject.io or configure the project name inside of the config.

    The above sample is a bit

    I have initially set up 3 different tests for the repo cards.  I set a list of repos that I expect to show up in the cards.  These tests are quite easy to do with TestProject.io as it is using selenium and a headless browser to execute javascript under the hood.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are not familiar a
    <strong>
     headless browser
    </strong>
    runs the engine as your browser without a graphical user interface.  JavaScript gets fully loaded and parsed, and the dom is completely interactive programmatically.

    I think the most interesting part of the workflow above is how we wait for the agent to register.  The shell script is a bit terse, but it looks for exceeding the

     max_attempts
    </code>
    allowed or that the agent has started by using its
    <code>
     /api/status

    rest API.  This prevents us from wasting too much time by setting a big wait, or trying to move on too early and running pytest without a running agent.
