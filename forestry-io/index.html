    Testing out forestry.io

   <h2>
    Sorry Netlify CMS
   </h2>
   <p>
    <em>

    <em>

   </p>
   <p>
    I have been playing with the netlify cms for a while now, and it has been a decent experience, but I
    <strong>
     really
    </strong>
    struggle configuring it.   Forestry is so simple to setup.  My favorite part is that I can code up my gatsby.js site, storing all editable text in markdown, and come back later and add the CMS based on existing documents.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Configuration is Simple
   </h2>
   <p>
    Forestry.io has this amazing feature to create
    <em>
     create based on existing document
    </em>
    ü§Ø.  This is great because it sets up the
    <code>
     .yml
    </code>
    config for me without error.  And If I really want to come back later to customize it more I have that option, too.

   <h2>
    Multi-File Gallery
   </h2>
   <p>
    I have a use case for a photography site where the owner wants to be able to show off sample photos of each type of work she does.  I got it working in the netlify cms, although it was not very user friendly.  Everything was nested in an accordian üò¢.

   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Next I looked into forestry.io.  I pointed forestry.io at the existing git repo, created a template based on an existing document and
    <strong>
     BAM
    </strong>
    üí• a nice image grid appeared.

   <h2>
    Editor
   </h2>
   <p>
    The forestry.io editor is on point.  I can choose to edit using the WYSIWYG editor and still use markdown syntax!  I can edit in markdown.  I can add images without fat-fingering the path and screwing up the whole post.  Its amazing!
   </p>

   <h2>
    Images
   </h2>
   <p>
    Image upload is on point!  Just click the add image button, it pops you into your media library, choose an image, or upload it, and you're off to the races üèá.

   <h2>
    Im Sold üí≤
   </h2>
   <p>
    At this point, I am sold. This blog is now written from Forestry, and I love it.  It's great when I am away from my editor to make some progress on the go.  If I decide I dont like it in 6 months, I can move on. All of my content is still in markdown on the git repo.
   </p>
   <p>
    Forestry.io is missing the nice side-by-side preview that netlify cms has, but honestly, I have struggled to set that up, too.  If I am being honest, I just play front end developer on the side, and setting up a CMS is not something that I plan on doing every day.  I am perfectly happy having some gui tools, like forestry.io, setup all of the configuration for me with just a few clicks.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Bonus
   </h2>
   <p>
    Preview is Nice üëå.  Without configuring anything except a bash one-liner, I have a preview that is not quite instant, but does kick out my actual site with updated content quickly.
