    Today I learned how to diff between two branches.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code>git diff feature..main</code></pre>
   <p>
    Sometimes we get a little
    <code>
     git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "WIP"
    </code>
    happy and mistakenly commit something that we just can't figure out. This is a good way to figure out what the heck has changed on the current branch compared to any other branch.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Example
   </h2>
   <p>
    Let's create a new directory, initialize git and toss some content into a readme.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash">mkdir git-diff
git init
echo "hello there" &gt; readme.md
git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "hello there"
cat readme.md</code></pre>
   <p>
    After all of that, we have a git repository on our local machine with a single file
    <code>
     readme.md
    </code>
    that contains the following.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash">hello there</code></pre>
   <h2>
    Create a branch and ‚úç edit
   </h2>
   <p>
    Let's checkout a new branch called Waylon and change the word
    <code>
     there
    </code>
    to
    <code>
     Waylon
    </code>
    in our
    <code>
     readme.md
    </code>
    file, then diff it.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash">git checkout -b Waylon
echo "hello Waylon" &gt; readme.md
git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "hello Waylon"
git diff</code></pre>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-diff">- hello there
+ hello waylon</code></pre>
   <p>
    At this point we have one commit.  Things are really straightforward, and our diff will be the same between the last commit and the main branch since.  Let's make another commit by adding the date.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash">echo "hello waylon\n\n$(date)" &gt; readme.md
cat readme.md
git diff</code></pre>
   <p>
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-diff">hello Waylon
+
+ Fri 13 Mar 2020 04:23:21 PM DST</code></pre>
   üëÜ At this point, our diff doesn't tell us the whole story between our current state and main, only between our current state and our last commit.  Let's commit our changes and compare our branch to main.
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash">git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "add date"
git diff main..waylon</code></pre>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-diff">- hello there
+ hello Waylon
+
+ Fri 13 Mar 2020 03:43:21 PM DST</code></pre>
   <h2>
    Git is powerful
   </h2>
   <p>
    I learn small tricks like this often with git.  Many times I forget about it and have to come back to re-learn. Sharing my thoughts gives me a better chance of remembering.
