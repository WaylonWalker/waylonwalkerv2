   <h4>
    Special Moments
   </h4>
   <p>
    I love having those special moments of time with the kids.  Today we had a few minutes to play before supper time, and we decided to go down to the basement to play some imagination action adventure game.  The kids are really into minecraft at the moment so its always very centered around minecraft.  Tonight there was an extra special moment where Wyatt on his own gave Ayla his brand new nerf gun to play with.  At this point he has not alowed her to play with it because it was a new Christmas toy.  She was extatic, and we all enjoyed running from her as she shot towards us.  I thought it was extra special because we were all having fun and no one was arguing about who got the new toy.  I am so proud of Wyatt, because he is really growing up and growing out of the not sharing phase. I have really seen him open up to share an play with Ayla in new ways lately.  It really makes you feel like a good parent when you can watch them grow up like this.
