   <h2>
    How to do it.
   </h2>
   <p>
    I had to do a bit of searching and found a great post from
    <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/neovim-eyecandy/">
     vimcasts
    </a>
    that shows exactly how to get the live search and replace highlighting using
    <code>
     inccomand
    </code>
   </p>
   <h2>
    :h inccommand
   </h2>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-vim">'inccommand' 'icm'  string  (default "")
            global

    "nosplit": Shows the effects of a command incrementally, as you type.
    "split"  : Also shows partial off-screen results in a preview window.

    Works for |:substitute|, |:smagic|, |:snomagic|. |hl-Substitute|

    If the preview is too slow (exceeds 'redrawtime') then 'inccommand' is
    automatically disabled until |Command-line-mode| is done.
</code></pre>
   <h2>
    Add this to your config
   </h2>
   <p>
    I believe that this is a neovim only feature, add it into your
    <code>
     ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
    </code>
    file. You can see it in my
    <a href="https://github.com/WaylonWalker/devtainer/blob/main/dotfiles/.config/nvim/settings.vim#L155">
     dotfiles
    </a>
    as well.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-vim">set inccommand=nosplit</code></pre>
