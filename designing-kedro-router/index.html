   <h2>
    nodes_global
   </h2>
   <p>
    I released a router-like plugin for kedro back in April 2020.  This was not the first design, the idea actually came from one of the QB folks who taught me kedro nearly a year before.  We were assembling our pipelines with something called
    <code>
     nodes_global
    </code>
    .  It worked fairly well but did have some issues around being set as a global variable.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     But...
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    One thing in particular that it did not lend itself well to was being able to create a packagable pipeline that I could pip install and append into any of my existing pipelines.  Something I am still trying to work out, maybe I don't need this.  I think I have it working for our internal pipelines and it seems like the way to go, but we don't necessarily end up using it.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Also...
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    With this pattern all of the nodes needed to be importable by the module containing nodes_global.  I find that this becomes a big hurdle for new pipelines coming from jupyter to overcome and can be most infuriating when their nodes aren't getting ran after they added them.

   <p>
    I set off to design something that was flask-like.  Around November I had something working.  You could simply start creating functions. and decorate these functions with a decorator just like with flask.  I even had it setup to autoname the nodes things like
    <code>
     create_b_int_cars
    </code>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     But....
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    This did not lend well to pulling in functions from a library or dynamically creating nodes.  I didn't realize how few nodes I actually make in my pipelines that are a 1:1 relationship between the node and function in real work.  Most examples work this way, but for some reason when I step into a project we end up pulling a lot of functions out of existing libraries, or dynamically creating many datasets from a list of options.

    pytest inspired
   </h2>

    <em>
     simplicity

   </p>
   <p>
    The final design ended up being suggested by a colleague of mine who is not using kedro, but is a  brilliant python dev.  The idea was to walk through the project like pytest does looking for modules and variables with a certain pattern (
    <code>
     node
    </code>
    , or
    <code>
     pipeline
    </code>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    I have been using this since April and am loving it. It has have very little change since first release.  When I create a new module, that automatically becomes a new pipeline in my
    <code>
     pipelines
    </code>
    dict and all of the variables with the name node get scrapped up and put into a single pipeline.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Beginner Friendly
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Just like with pytest.  You just start hacking in modules ending with
    <code>
     _nodes.py
    </code>
    with nodes in them and they just appear in your final pipeline.

    How to use it

   <p>
    The
    <a href="https://github.com/WaylonWalker/find-kedro">

    </a>
    has some great examples.

   <h2>

   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">pip install find-kedro</code></pre>

    Enable it by changing one line in your run.py

class ProjectContext(KedroContext):

   <p>
    Or if your using the new
    <code>
     hooks.py
    </code>
    method.  Again no need to import all of your nodes.
