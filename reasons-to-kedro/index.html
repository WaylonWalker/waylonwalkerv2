    There are many reasons that you should be using kedro.  If you are on a team of
Data Scientists/Data Engineers processing DataFrames from many data sources
should be considering a pipeline framework.  Kedro is a great option that
provides many benefits for teams to collaborate, develop, and deploy data
pipelines

   <h2>
    Starter Template
   </h2>
   <p>
    Kedro makes it super easy to get started with their cli that utilizes
cookiecutter under the hood.

   <h2>
    Collaboration
   </h2>
   <p>
    Kedro provides many tools that help teams collaborate on a single codebase.
While writing monolithic scripts it can be easy to pin yourself in a corner
where it is difficult to have multiple people making changes to the
notebook/script at the same time.  Kedro helps guide your team to break your
project down into small pieces that different members of the team can work on
in parallel.
   </p>
   <h3>
    sharable catalog
   </h3>
   <p>
    Kedro makes it easy to collaborate with members who aren't even working on the
pipeline.  I often see team members who want to investigate datasets from
different points in the pipeline.  Kedro makes it really easy for them to load
it into python.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     for python users
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Share catalog entries with folks doing EDA.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">catalog.load('main_table')</code></pre>
   <p>
    <strong>
     for non-python users
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    For those who may not be using python, we can easily kick out a CSV version of
that
    <code>
     main_table
    </code>
    that they can get from s3 or your cloud storage solution of
choice.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml">master_table:
  type: pandas.CSVDataSet
  filepath: s3://bucket/data/03_primary/master_table.csv
  layer: primary</code></pre>
   <p>
    <strong>
     for the SQL folks
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    We aren't even constrained to those who only use python or excel, we can kick
out any kind of dataset that python can output.  Kedro even comes with many
DataSet types out of the box so that we don't have to write any read/write
code.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml">master_table:
  type: SQLTableDataSet
  table_name: master_table
  credentials: postgres</code></pre>
   <h3>
    small nodes over monolithic scripts
   </h3>
   <p>
    As I said before single notebooks/scripts are really hard to collaborate on.  I
have seen Data Engineers sitting idle waiting to get their changes manually
added into the master notebook.  When you find yourself in this situation, find
a better solution.  It's time to break things down into individual modules and
utilize a version control system that can automatically merge changes in.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kedro encourages the use of git version control and storing all node functions
inside of modules while still making it really easy to load data into a
notebook/shell and start trying out new things.
   </p>
   <h2>
    No More read and write code
   </h2>
   <p>
    As I said earlier kedro comes with datasets for the most popular output
formats.  It is also backed by a really amazing library called
    <code>
     fsspec
    </code>
    , this
library makes the filesystem that you are storing agnostic to how you write to
it.  This means that the kedro library utilizes
    <code>
     fsspec
    </code>
    under the hood and
writes to the file as if it was to disk, but based on the prefix to the file it
may actually be writing to the local filesystem, gcp, azure blob, or s3.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     custom DataSets
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    If kedro does not have a
    <code>
     DataSet
    </code>
    for the format that you need to read or
write you can easily create your own custom
    <code>
     DataSet
    </code>
    all you need to do is
inherit from
    <code>
     kedro.io.AbstractDataSet
    </code>
    and create methods for
    <code>
     __init__
    </code>
    ,
    <code>
     _load
    </code>
    ,
    <code>
     _save
    </code>
    ,
    <code>
     _exists
    </code>
    , and
    <code>
     _describe
    </code>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Check out this example from their docs.  I removed the docstrings for brevity,
you can see the entire
    <code>
     DataSet
    </code>
    in their
    <a href="https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/0.15.2/03_tutorial/03_set_up_data.html?highlight=custom%20dataset#creating-custom-datasets">
     docs
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The complete example all in one was only available in an older version, more up to date

   <h2>
    Execution order is taken care of
   </h2>
   <p>
    As you build up complex pipelines containing 10's or 100's of nodes it becomes
difficult to splice in new nodes/steps without messing up or a framework to
help.  Kedro simply needs a set of nodes that each takes in catalog entries as
input and output to catalog entries and it will figure out the order for you.
   </p>
   <p>
    These nodes can be made for one-off purposes, take in functions from reusable
libraries, and even be dynamically generated from a configuration.  There is
no need to worry about hand curating the execution order, that's all taken care
of.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Easily slice up a pipeline
   </h2>
   <p>
    Since kedro is a DAG that takes in a pile of nodes and figures out all of the
dependencies for you it knows a lot about your pipeline.  You can slice it up to
only the specific pieces that you need.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python"># single nodes
pipeline.only_nodes("node1")

# single nodes and all of thier dependencies
pipeline.to_nodes("node1", "node2")

# from a dataset to all of its dependants
pipeline.from_inputs("dataset1", "dataset2")

# to a an outputs with all of its dependencies
pipeline.to_outputs("dataset6", "dataset7")</code></pre>
   <h2>
    plugins/hooks
   </h2>
   <p>
    Creating your own modifications to how kedro behaves is made really simple
through the use of hooks.  There are several hooks that happen at different
points in the kedro lifecycle.  For instance, you can hook in before pipeline
run or after pipeline run to do whatever your project needs.

   <h3>
    pip install plugin
   </h3>
   <p>
    There is a growing list of plugins available from pypi that is only a
    <code>
     pip
install
    </code>
    away.  Most of them are on
    <a href="https://github.com/topics/kedro-plugin">
     GitHub
    </a>
    and tagged as a
    <a href="https://github.com/topics/kedro-plugin">

    </a>
    topic.
   </p>
   <h2>
    flexible cli
   </h2>
   <p>
    In the end, you have a cli for your project that can run your pipeline in all
sorts of cool ways since it knows about each node's dependencies.  This makes
running and scheduling production a breeze.
   </p>
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash"># single nodes
kedro run --node node1

# single nodes and all of their dependencies
kedro run --to-nodes node1,node2 

# from a dataset to all of its dependents
kedro run --from-inputs dataset1,dataset2

# to outputs with all of their dependencies
kedro run --to-outputs dataset6,dataset7</code></pre>
   <h2>
    Try it out
   </h2>
   <p>
    Hopefully this post gave you the inspiration to get started today, if it did
    <code>
     pip install kedro
    </code>
    and run
    <code>
     kedro new
    </code>
    to try it out.
