   <h4>
    Freedom to learn
   </h4>
   <p>
    I am very grateful that I have the freedom to learn the things I need to in order to advance my skills and grow my career.  I am very stretched for time, just like everyone else, but I am able to get the things done that I need to and still find time for learning.  I talk to some people that do not have the time.  They are piled so high with tasks to do that there is no time to learn.  I a grateful that my leadership sees value in it and do not really ask questions as long as tasks are being completed on time.
